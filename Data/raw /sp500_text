POOL.OQ	2022-10-20T11:00:00Z	Revenue	5932537920	5808943380	I mean you've had years of successful capacity creation and this recent inflation taking things to a higher price level.	Transcript
POOL.OQ	2023-02-16T11:00:00Z	EBIT			In view of the potential for flat to slightly lower sales, gross margin compression and inflationary pressures on expenses, we would anticipate operating margin to decline as much as 100 to 150 basis points compared to 2022 full year results. We believe we can achieve a 15% operating margin even under these reduced sales expectations by continuing an intense focus on expense management and the crisp operating execution we have demonstrated consistently over time.	Transcript
CHRW.OQ	2022-05-25T10:55:00Z	Revenue			I mean throughout the balance of this year, should we expect to see volume grow at a rate ahead of head count growth? That would be the goal as we get through kind of with the Q3, Q4 into next year.	Transcript
CHRW.OQ	2023-04-26T17:00:00Z	EBITDA			As you would expect, the cash that we used to reduce debt generally reduces the amount of cash available for share repurchases.	Transcript
CHRW.OQ	2022-07-27T17:00:00Z	EBIT			And so while the market will undoubtedly shift from this point over time, we've got a clear view on what it's going to take to deliver against that 40% operating margin target through the cycle, both in terms of the components of volume, AGP per transaction and just our overall cost structure.

AJG.N	2023-01-26T17:15:00Z	Revenue			So as I sit here today, '23 could be another fantastic year with brokerage organic growth nicely in the 7% to 9% range.	Transcript
AJG.N	2023-04-27T17:15:00Z	Revenue			And then in terms of the organic outlook, still kind of keeping the 7% to 9% range for the year, can you just give us a sense of kind of what you're embedding in there for the economy as well as pricing when you think about -- or are you just expecting, in general, a stable environment over the next few quarters compared to what we saw in Q1?

AJG.N	2023-01-26T17:15:00Z	EBITDA			Another year of double-digit growth and margin expansion would be another terrific year. Flipping to Page 7. The Risk Management adjusted EBITDAC margin of 19.3% in the quarter and 18.5% for the full year. Looking forward, full year '23 organic should be pushing 10% and adjusted EBITDAC margins should be around 19%. Moving on to our Risk Management segment, Gallagher Bassett. The way I look at the math, it might say that an additional $773 million of free cash, combined maybe another $70 million of recurring EBITDAC at that 10 to 11x multiple, which would then have a nice arbitrage for our current trading multiple. We see a nice step-up in '23 with margins around 19% even as we continue to make investments to enhance the client experience and in analytics and tools to drive better claim outcomes.	Transcript
AJG.N	2022-01-27T17:15:00Z	EBIT			And to be clear, all of these comments are before the impact of the acquisition of Willis Re. Then by 2023, we could be back to that pre-pandemic view that margin expansion might occur at a 4% or so organic level.	Transcript
AJG.N	2023-04-27T17:15:00Z	EBITDA			I think the accounting and the deferred revenue from 606 in the fourth quarter, plus maybe the life cases, I mean we have -- so as more life cases come in pretty lumpy, those probably cost us 50 basis points, the combination of the 2, and full year organic something like that. So you can see here, this quarter was up, fueled about 90 basis points.	Transcript
AJG.N	2023-04-27T17:15:00Z	EBITDA			As we look forward, we're seeing the rest of the year organic in that 12% to 13% range and full year margins now finishing a bit above 19%.	Transcript

WM.N	2023-03-16T08:00:00Z	EBITDA	20781390000	20485920000	And in '23, we're expecting 13% more EBITDA than we generated in '17. Can you just help us understand, is recycling a bundled offering with your waste collection business? What are the roadblocks to getting to 100% fee-for-service?	Transcript
WM.N	2023-04-27T10:00:00Z	Revenue	5975000000	5825000000	For the full year, we continue to expect flat overall volumes at the midpoint of our guidance. Our collection volumes were down modestly in the quarter, driven by intentional steps we continue to take to price every contract to achieve acceptable returns. This has led to some non-regrettable volume losses in our residential and commercial business. With profitability improving in each line of business and contract wins with healthy price increases, we're pleased to see our differentiated service and disciplined approach yield benefits.	Transcript
WM.N	2023-03-16T08:00:00Z	EBIT			Can you kind of just expand on some of those cost levers and what you can do to drive operating margin?	Transcript
WM.N	2023-03-08T08:40:00Z	EBITDA			And I know that if you look at your margins, they probably are under a little bit of pressure in the first half, but we kind of get back to that point where we reach that inflection. But if I just look at my core business and taking margins up by kind of -- if today it's going to be kind of 28.5% to 29%, taking it solidly through 30% on the core side through what she talked about on cost controls, and efficiencies and using data and analytics. But the idea here is this is a business that should be able to at least meet its cost inflation and hopefully a little bit more? There is a lot going on with commodities and stuff going on in the margins.	Transcript
BA.N	2022-10-26T10:30:00Z	Revenue			On the 87 program, we delivered 9 airplanes in the quarter and have 115 airplanes in inventory. We still anticipate delivery of the first 777-9 airplane in 2025 and continue to coordinate with the FAA to prioritize resources across our development programs.	Transcript
BA.N	2023-01-25T10:30:00Z	Revenue			On the commercial delivery front, 737 deliveries are unchanged and between 400 and 450 airplanes, 787 deliveries are unchanged between 70 and 80 airplanes, and we've added a couple of items on the expense front. On the services side, so we had a big year for the services business.	Transcript
BA.N	2023-04-26T10:30:00Z	Revenue			The work will impact the timing of our deliveries over the next several months.	Transcript
BA.N	2023-01-25T10:30:00Z	EBIT			Yes, sure.	Transcript
BA.N	2023-03-22T06:35:00Z	EBIT			So we see all that in front of us, that will get us to a point where margins will look more familiar to what you've seen in the past.	Transcript
BA.N	2023-04-26T10:30:00Z	EBIT			And of course, as Dave mentioned, by the time we get to '25, '26, we still see a path to get BCA back to the double-digit margins that you all recognize. But as we move into the back half of the year, the margins will improve. Maybe how do we think about BCA margins going forward?	Transcript
FOX.OQ	2023-05-09T08:30:00Z	Revenue			And so with another sort of 1/3 of our book due for renewal in fiscal '24 and a touch under 30% during fiscal '25, we feel pretty confident that we can continue to deliver pricing gains in subscribers. If the subscriber rate of attrition stays at the same level, we expect to post ongoing affiliate revenue growth for the company.	Transcript

MCD.N	2023-04-25T08:30:00Z	Revenue			So I think certainly, you can kind of see a path forward where operating margin could come up a little bit from where our guidance is today if we continue to see that strong top line result over the course of the rest of the year, but there are several ifs there.

SPG.N	2023-05-02T17:00:00Z	Revenue			And looking at the guidance raise, how much of that property -- core property NOI versus maybe other factors? I'm guessing it's not that straightforward. If we have an uptick in sales, we'll do better. Just maybe can you give us an update how you're thinking about that number for the rest of the year? So the outlook on that front is very positive and unchanged since our commentary at the -- certainly, at the beginning of this year and fourth quarter of last year as well. So wondering if you could discuss that rent maturity and mark-to-market outlook?	Transcript

AIG.N	2022-02-17T08:30:00Z	EBIT			Although there are several opposite forces that work, such as economic and social inflation, my sense is that the 2022 market will continue to produce tight terms and conditions and strong pricing to sustain additional margin expansion into calendar 2023.

MCO.N	2023-04-25T12:30:00Z	Revenue			And that's, again, based on our expectation for market volatility to partially abate in the latter half of 2023. We now expect first half MIS revenue to decline in the mid- to high single-digit percent range and second half MIS revenue growth in the mid- to high teens percent range. We're also pleased to reaffirm our expectation for full year 2023 MA revenue to increase by approximately 10%.	Transcript
MCO.N	2022-10-25T12:30:00Z	Revenue			But we think that the rate of declines have probably bottomed out here in the third or fourth quarter, and we'll start to see gradual improvement throughout the balance of next year. Even though we've got -- so we've got a tough comp in the first quarter of next year from an issuance perspective. So if you could just be a little more specific what you meant when you think fourth and third quarter is likely to be a trough for debt issuance, noting that we still have unfavorable mix in the fourth quarter, like when would you expect MIS revenue to start to improve? So what I really meant was that the year-over-year quarterly declines in revenue in MIS, we would expect a trough in the third, fourth quarter of this year.	Transcript
MCO.N	2022-05-02T11:30:00Z	EBIT			And finally, just to sort of close out this one, our path to our medium-term MA margin target of mid-30s, it's not expected to be linear, especially as we continue to make opportunistic investments as time goes on.	Transcript
MCO.N	2022-02-10T11:30:00Z	EBIT			As such, over the coming 5 years, we project Moody's revenue to grow by at least 10% on an average annualized basis and adjusted operating margin to stabilize in the low 50s percent range.	Transcript

And in terms of our current outlook, as we sit here today, we still expect that revenue and segment operating income growth for this fiscal year will be in the high single-digit percentage range, and we look forward to updating you on our progress as we move forward.

First, we are anticipating lower COVID collections of $3 million in 2023 compared to $20 million last year. Please note that we increased our full year noncash revenue guidance from $30 million a quarter ago to account for new information, including an assumption that we will continue converting tenants to accrual accounting in 2023, as well as the likelihood that we will recognize accelerated below-market rent amortization triggered by the potential for bankruptcy-related store closures.

So we have a lot of upcoming kind of strategy that we believe is going to continue to play well for us, and it's all kind of baked in the kind of nice growth trajectory, still it's 8 years -- 8% for the 2021 to 2025 CAGR, which is still pretty nice profile, which is definitely higher than the historical kind of growth profile for Bio-Rad.

VTR.N	2023-02-10T10:00:00Z	Revenue			It is important to note that 80% of our revenue growth in 2023 will be driven by the RevPOR growth, much of which has already been realized as over half of our resident population have already received the rent increases. This, in combination with improved care pricing, rising street rates and typical resident attrition, results in about 6% expected RevPOR growth in 2023. We anticipate year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 8% at the midpoint of the same-store cash NOI guidance range driven by continued strong rate growth and occupancy growth of 130 to 170 basis points. We are projecting unprecedented organic growth in our portfolio, once again driven by SHOP, and complemented by the positive compounding contributions of our office business led by Pete.	Transcript
VTR.N	2023-05-09T10:00:00Z	EBIT			We completed 13 of the 15 planned NOI-generating CapEx projects in this portfolio in the fourth quarter of 2022.

ZBRA.OQ	2023-05-24T08:40:00Z	EBITDA	1246383600	1195510800	And that's with still about 70 bps impact from supply chain costs as well over the last 2 years, we've had a 150 basis point headwind in FX. Can we be in that 48%, even despite some of the pressure top line? I think the one thing I'd say just in terms of broader margin, if you look at where we ended our guide for the year at 22% EBITDA, it's about a 50 basis points increase from where we were in 2019. So I think both from OpEx leverage as well as the underlying gross margin of the business remains healthy, and we just -- once we get past the supply chain, and again, we feel like there's, again, continued opportunity to expand, particularly as we grow other parts of the portfolio that have an inherently higher margin such as machine vision and software. So let's jump into margins. So supply chain costs have come down materially. You're one of the few that have split out kind of the supply chain cost, made it easy for us analysts, but talk about -- how do we think about margins in the range for this year?	Transcript
ZBRA.OQ	2023-05-02T08:30:00Z	EBITDA			We expect full year adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 22%, which is the low end of our previous outlook.	Transcript

We are confident in Seagate's ability to translate areal density leadership into the most advantaged TCO across a broad range of customers from the highest capacity drives used in cloud data centers to lower and mid-cap drives more typically used by enterprise and VIA customers. We are tracking well to our stated plans and achieved the key milestone last week of shipping initial qualification units to a cloud launch partner, and we expect to recognize initial revenue from 30-plus terabyte platforms this quarter as part of our Corvault system solutions. We currently expect the high-volume ramp to begin in early calendar 2024, depending on customer qualification time lines and prevailing macro conditions at that time.	Transcript

And so that's what you've seen so far? And we have a pathway in terms of looking at our current businesses, looking at our product pipeline. I think we'll demonstrate that this year. I think what I will say is growth at the high end of med tech is still on the table, and we haven't really backed away from that. So is there a framework to think about 2023 that you can offer? That is what we are seeing. We have a lot of exciting new products that are coming out next year that I think will help drive the top line. Yes.	Transcript

SYY.N	2021-11-09T10:00:00Z	EBIT			Aaron, I'll toss to you for any additional comments. And those 2 levers in combination is what expands the EBIT margin. But sales growth and cost reductions, not for margin rate growth. I do not believe that, that growth will come primarily from product margin expansion. I would just add, in support of Kevin's point, that I am also excited by elements of our merchandising and our supply chain transformation that, over time, as we work through this very inflationary period, should provide us with new opportunities. If you think about look out to '24, '25 take a longer-term view, are you more confident in gross margin being better than it's been historically? In particular, I'm excited with the work that's underway in connection with Sysco's private label brand and other elements that will be supportive of our overall financial profile. It's going to come from continued disciplined expense optimization by taking structural costs out and investing in capabilities that drive the top line. John, what we've articulated is we're really bullish on our EBIT margin expanding that we will move that needle. Or that the cost structure of the business will be less, right, in light of some -- a lot of the macro dynamics we're seeing today? So to answer your question, while the short term certainly were challenged from a -- or it's lower than we would have hoped, from a gross margin perspective because of the impact of inflation over the longer term, the 24% and the 25%, we are quite bullish. So why the EBIT margin grows is, a, the top line will be accelerating; b, we'll be taking structural costs out of the business. Then maybe the second question, right? Which 1 of those 2 is more likely to drive higher long-term profit margins?	Transcript

As a result, all else equal, operating profit dollars remain neutral from cost recovery pricing actions, the results in margin compression. At this time, currency is projected to have a minimal impact on our 2023 results. For Masco overall, we are planning for volumes to be down in the low double-digit range, partially offset by low single-digit pricing. I mean 15.8% margin in the first quarter, 2Q and 3Q are generally well above the first quarter and the full year outlook is 15%. So with overall, our 10% guide to the top line being down, I think that weighs on it.	Transcript

BEN.N	2022-11-01T11:00:00Z	EBIT			35% to 40% of our adjusted expense base is variable with the market, but we're also very focused, Jenny asked me to do this in sort of one of my new roles here is to be very focused on the other 60% to 65%. And I think we do expect the margin to go a little bit down before it comes back up. And as I mentioned, we expect to absorb all of that into our cost base. And how much do you have wiggle room in order to continue to grind that down through the year as we work through this very, very challenging environment. And obviously, it's an inflationary environment that you've got Alcentra. And we're finding other places within Franklin Templeton to be more efficient so that we end up with an attractive expense base given the very difficult market conditions. But how much is Alcentra adding into that 3.95 to 4 base? By absorb it, I don't mean cut it. I think what you're sort of getting at in a way is the margin. I'll just point to a couple of important things. So I want to make that clear. So on Alcentra, it's approximately $100 million. So this is how -- this is where scale can matter where we can find other places to be more efficient across the platform. We're not cutting costs over in London in the company we just acquired. Yes. Thanks, Brennan. You helped us sort of quantify the -- what your expectation is for an uplift to T&E.	Transcript

I mean, can you just maybe talk about what you're seeing from a pricing environment perspective? I mean, maybe kind of building on that, right? I mean, there's a lot of discussion around pricing. So let me start with the macro view and then yes, we could take it down to North America. So we've taken price through '22, including at the fourth quarter.	Transcript
CE.N	2023-02-20T16:30:00Z	EBITDA			The expansion provides approximately 35 percent incremental EVA capacity approximately $10 million per year in additional operating EBITDA across the integrated acetyl value chain with the earnings contributions ramping across starting in the first quarter of 2023. The project is expected to deliver the second quarter.	Press Release
CE.N	2022-01-28T10:00:00Z	Revenue			And I suspect we'll see others in the industry doing so, but I will say it's still into a very tight market. And I think this is a market -- these are markets that will all continue to be very tight for the next, I'm going to say, at least 4 to 5 years. And I think we called out some VAM expansions. And I think what that means is, even with higher natural gas prices, because the marginal capacity in acetic acid is coming out of China, which is coal priced, you'll continue to see prices that support good margins in the Acetyl Chain as we go forward over the next few years. And so especially in Europe, we're just seeing a demand, quite frankly, that the industry can't keep up with right now. And then if you go into our downstream products like emulsions and RDP, I would say the demand is huge right now. And then maybe as a follow-up, since you get at acetic acid from kind of all 3 of the carbon starting points, can you talk about what's happening to the cost curve for acetic acid with all the different energy price moves we've seen in the last half year? And we make some systems that are made of -- if you think about kind of 5 layers of emulsions and RDP powders to make thermal insulation systems for putting on the externals of buildings. And where do you think either you or the industry might make some announcements around new capacity in that chain over the next couple of years? But again, in the first quarter, we see it being really tight again as we have some outages, especially in China, for turnarounds as well as some maintenance downtime. But we do have some new capacity coming on sometime in the next few months with the second phase of Huayi Guangxi. First question is just on the Acetyl Chain. I think as we've called out before, acetic acid, any major expansions will take a while. I would say VAM has been around 100% utilization for some time now. I would say the entire view of the chain is pretty tight right now. It was a little bit better in the fourth quarter. Just look at utilization, acetic acid had been pretty close to 100%. Now that did moderate a little bit in the fourth quarter, but still 85% to 90% utilization in acetic acid. Other than our old Clear Lake capacity that will come on first half of 2022 -- 2023, sorry, I get the wrong -- right year, 2023. So I do think we'll see some expansion. So I think VAM is going to continue to be very tight. So I'd say those utilization rates are definitely at 100% and staying that way. There's been a few other ones, but I think the demand in VAM continues to grow quite rapidly. There's some really interesting things happening in the market now around increased energy efficiency requirements. VAM is very tight. We see that being about the same this quarter and maybe tightening a little bit as we go through the year. We're at least 4 to 5 years out from any other expansions there. We're making -- we are looking to expand RDP as well. We've announced some expansions in VAM. We've called out some VAE expansions. What will '22 look like different than '21 from a cost curve standpoint? When you look at the different steps from acetic acid down to VAM and some of the other derivatives, where do you see the supply demand being the tightest over the next couple of years?	Transcript
CE.N	2022-02-18T08:30:00Z	Revenue			And then some years, it may be a little bit lower, but we really do believe that 5% is a sustainable growth level. And then, Scott, maybe on slide 15 where you had the 5% sales CAGR. And what are the other constituents that led to the 5%? Can you just give us a bit more color on that dynamic? From a revenue standpoint, the steel business has some more volatility to that, but more kind of historically low single digits, largely driven by price, at least over the last decade as opposed to volume. How much of that is sort of driven by just cyclicality in some of the currently challenged end markets like auto OEM recover? So we bring this business in to Engineered Materials, we expect that revenue growth again to be kind of more in that mid- to high single-digit range overall. So when we kind of blend that together that 5%, we think, is kind of over time where we'll land on average kind of with the blended portfolio. Some years, it's going to be higher than that, and we do expect we have that opportunity here over the next several years.	Transcript

TPR.N	2022-08-18T08:00:00Z	Revenue	6700000000	6700000000	On a reported basis, we anticipate revenue in the area of $6.9 billion, which represents growth of 3% to 4% and includes roughly 300 basis points of FX headwinds from the significant appreciation of the U.S. dollar. Our guidance assumes balanced growth with all brands and channels contributing to constant currency top line gains for the year. Specifically, we expect revenue and earnings growth versus prior year to be back half weighted, helped by the sequential improvement planned in China as we move throughout the year. We are increasingly confident in the brand's opportunity to achieve $2 billion in revenue and a high-teens operating margin over our planning horizon.	Transcript

TPR.N	2022-11-10T08:00:00Z	EBIT			In addition, we anticipate a year-over-year operating margin decline of over 70 basis points, which now incorporates the expectation for FX pressure of roughly 120 basis points compared to our prior outlook for 100 basis points of impact. This contemplates gross margin relatively in line with, to slightly below prior year, reflecting the benefit of moderating freight costs as well as AUR increases across all brands. We expect the majority of this FX headwind to flow through the gross margin line. We expect these tailwinds to be offset by the previously anticipated rising input costs for materials as well as the negative impact of FX, as mentioned.	Transcript

Maybe that's a good segue in to -- I'll talk about our operating model, which is a little bit more of the longer-term financial objectives that we see based on the markets that we serve. So we're profiling out our 2025 estimates of greater than $750 million organically and potentially over $1 billion with M&A.

Our year-to-date number is 8.8%, which I mentioned, and we provided 7% to 8% for the year. So the 3% to 5% is what is implied in the fourth quarter is what is implied with the overall guidance. The number that we report, which is -- includes the headwinds from term fees and prior period rents, in the fourth quarter, should be about, call it, 3% to 5%, in line with what we did this quarter at 3.7%.

But in terms of payers, we have very good conversations with the payers, very constructive. Patrick, I'll start, and I'll ask Glenn to give some specifics. So I feel good about price and price mix as we go through this year to next year. So top line growth, LaunchPad savings, not having the constraints will drive the margin improvement.

DRI.N	2022-09-22T08:30:00Z	EBITDA			And part of that is the shrinking gap between pricing and inflation. And then as we get to the back half, we expect to be higher than last year. And then as we look at the full year, do we still expect restaurant level margins to be better than pre-COVID? So the question is, do you still expect those store level margins to exceed pre-COVID levels for the full year? Where are we from an EBIT margin? Yes, that's what's embedded in our guidance for the full year.	Transcript
DRI.N	2022-06-23T08:30:00Z	Revenue			And we have said throughout COVID that we expect our off-premise sales as a percent to be higher than they were pre-COVID and probably higher than the 20%. And we want to make sure that we get to equilibrium before we kind of give a new goal. But I will say that we expect it to be higher than it was pre-COVID, and we expect it to be higher than that initial kind of 20% goal, mainly because of the investments that we've made, and what a great job our team members do to make sure that their guests get their food on time and it's accurate. But before COVID, you guys were saying that Olive Garden could be a 20%-plus off-premise sales mix. Do you think just given the recent stickiness and strength of that, that it's more likely we'll see this hang in around 25% plus? Finally, turning to our financial outlook for fiscal 2023. My first question, Rick, is just around off-premise, that this is the fourth quarter now where you guys are running off-premise around a 25% to 30% sales range, holding on quite strong and quite sticky as the dine-in business rebounds. We are running at 25% plus now at Olive Garden. We expect total sales of $10.2 billion to $10.4 billion, representing growth of 6% to 8% from last year; same restaurant sales growth of 4% to 6% and 55 to 60 new restaurants; capital spending of $500 million to $550 million; total inflation of approximately 6%, and we plan to continue underpricing total inflation with annual pricing of approximately 5%. We're still not quite at equilibrium yet. Yes, Andrew.	Transcript

But similar -- what are maybe a couple of the top drivers that we get you back into that near $10 range on EPS? I know there are several things that you can probably mention, John. Is it mainly lower -- a better affordability environment driving higher housing turnover? So instead of a headwind with the macro environment becomes a tailwind, and then we grow -- I keep going back to '08 and '09 because I believe it's a similar environment and the similar dynamics. So we expect to grow not 1 to 2x the market, but 2 to 2.5 to 3x the market. We expect these actions will benefit segment margin over time as we drive a return to our high teens, low 20s adjusted margin target.	Transcript

So before we started the pivot, we were in the mid-20s SaaS revenues as a percentage of our annualized recurring revenues. So when we think about our revenue ambitions, we think about it in the context of that 2/3 of our business is the solutions segment business. So when we think about the solutions segments that we talked about, sort of starting off, as well as the Market Services business, a lot of beta factors go into market services.	Transcript

And the fact that we are projecting a flattish number of deliveries in 2023 versus 2022 displays the strength of our strategy. Finally, once again, given market volatility, we're providing boundaries for deliveries only first full year 2023 as we did last quarter, as Stuart mentioned, this delivery range should be 62,000 to 66,000, which is an increase of our previous range of 60,000 to 65,000. We maintain our volume to move through the limited legacy land that we have, which is at legacy prices, while keeping our production machine working efficiently and rationalizing costs.	Transcript

PLD.N	2023-01-18T12:00:00Z	EBIT			Given these assumptions, we believe our lease mark-to-market will be sustained or even increased over '23, ending the year between 65% and 70% and providing visibility to an incremental $2.9 billion of NOI after the more than $300 million that will become realized over the course of this year. I just want to make sure on the mark-to-market, numbers that are embedded in your same-store NOI growth of 8% to 9% GAAP and 8.5% to 9.5% cash. I think leasing spreads next year are going to be in the high 70s to low 80s on a net effective basis. So clearly, everything that will roll next year is going to be above the 67% reporting today. You clearly laid out the building blocks of your same store NOI growth of 8.5% to 9.5% in 2023, where you have a high level of visibility.	Transcript

I know you're selling -- or you're closing the refinery at the end of '23, but right now, refining margins are pretty phenomenal looking at $30 Gulf Coast cracks, $70 diesel cracks. Listen, for refining, yes, we're seeing very strong margins. Or is there a reason to be cautious on just overall margin capture? So to answer your question just very shortly, yes, we expect to be able to capture that margin uplift. So we're operating the assets very well, very high utilization rates. Thanks, Matthew, for the question. The Maya 2-1-1 today is over $60, very strong diesel cracks, gasoline cracks strongest since 2015, inventories are low.	Transcript

IBM.N	2022-03-09T14:30:00Z	Revenue			And obviously, the software business is a big part of that goal to get to sustained mid-single-digit revenue growth. And so just walk through how you would plan to achieve that, and particularly how you achieve sustainable growth, even though there is some cyclicality in parts of the software business like TPP. And then I get about 2 points from the rest of software. But I do have the negative headwind of our TP software, which is predicted to decline in the mid- to high single digits. But getting back to your point, we've promised and I promised with investors back in October that we get mid-single digits in the midterm, which is 22 to 24. But the combination of 4 plus 2 minus 1 gets me to mid-single-digit growth in the midterm. Didn't do that in the fourth quarter. It was certainly an easy compare. One of the, I think, most strategic things from an investor standpoint that Arvind did was to shift away from the focus on earnings towards sustainable revenue growth and free cash flow. That gives me about 4 points of tailwind to the software business. That's really a combination of Red Hat. We think that was a onetime event. We've seen great success with Red Hat thus far, grew 21% all in, in the fourth quarter. You say, well, what is that adds up to 6.	Transcript

And then we put out some implied margin guidance from our -- in our '20 by '25 plan, and it's not annually as strong as that. Can you just remind us, obviously with the pass-through impact, I know it wasn't the most profitable business. I think if you take the midpoint of our guidance, it's a little bit under 100 basis points of margin expansion there. I want to say, if you did the math on it, it comes to 20 to 30 basis points of margin expansion per year. The revenue comes down, but maybe the margin holds in as COVID fades, maybe just talk through that impact on the margin side.	Transcript

But what I would say is that we previewed the federal, once it got to around $1 billion, would grow at a mid-teens CAGR for the next several years, and end of the year, just under $1 billion. So that will put you in the mid-hundreds as far as contribution to the growth. They are the 1, 2, 3 by 2023 work to be done to build a $1 billion health network business by 2025. We don't necessarily break out the guidance at that level of detail. We're getting to about $150 million to $200 million, just want to make sure we're in the ballpark. When we think about the top line guidance, can you quantify for us the contribution from federal.	Transcript

We expect operating margins of between 2.5% and 3% and EBITDA margins of between 8% and 8.5%.	Transcript

CVS.N	2022-11-02T08:00:00Z	Revenue	338590350000	332141010000	And we expect that the economics on vaccines and diagnostic testing will change, following expiration of the public health emergency which we project will happen in the early part of the first quarter of 2023. In PSS, we are targeting mid-single-digit growth over our baseline. In addition to those specific adjustments, we are projecting that our Retail LTC segment will have over $3 billion of revenues in 2022 from COVID, which have a robust margin profile. It is not prudent to anticipate a similar level of COVID-based revenues going forward.	Transcript
CVS.N	2023-01-10T11:15:00Z	Revenue			Our specialty pharmacy business is expected to generate top line revenue growth of more than 20% in 2022, creating strong momentum that will allow us to continue to unlock the value to customers and drive results in 2023 and beyond.	Transcript
CVS.N	2022-11-02T08:00:00Z	Revenue			And we expect that the economics on vaccines and diagnostic testing will change, following expiration of the public health emergency which we project will happen in the early part of the first quarter of 2023.

CVS.N	2023-02-08T08:00:00Z	EBIT			Overall, for the Retail/LTC segment, we expect 2023 adjusted operating income to decline from 2022 to between $5.95 billion and $6.05 billion.	Transcript
CVS.N	2023-05-03T08:00:00Z	EBIT			In the Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness segment, our new adjusted operating income guidance is a range of $5.73 billion to $5.83 billion, reflecting lower-than-expected COVID volumes as well as the impact of resegmentation.	Transcript

PH.N	2023-05-04T11:00:00Z	Revenue	4083810000	4013700000	By FY '27, we will have approximately 85% of the company in long cycle end markets or industrial aftermarket. This mix shift is further reason why we will grow differently in the future, and it is why we are committed to our FY '27 target of 4% to 6% organic growth over the cycle.	Transcript
PH.N	2023-05-04T11:00:00Z	Revenue			Obviously, we increased our guidance this morning. So that will help us with the future year guidance. We'll come back to you in August with the full year guidance.	Transcript
PH.N	2023-03-07T11:00:00Z	EBITDA			We will get Meggitt to 30% adjusted EBITDA margins.	Transcript
PH.N	2023-02-02T11:00:00Z	EBIT			As I mentioned earlier, we're on track to achieve the $60 million in synergies by the end of this fiscal year.	Transcript
PH.N	2023-02-02T11:00:00Z	EBIT			And I just wanted to note that $0.25 of that is due to the less bad currency rates. And just as a reminder, we mentioned this last quarter, we do expect Meggitt to be just slightly dilutive to overall margins in this first stub-years as we generate those synergies that Jenny just spoke to. We are increasing segment operating income by $0.35 for the remainder of the second half.	Transcript
PH.N	2019-03-05T10:55:00Z	EBITDA			So we updated our goals early and said that by fiscal year '23, it's our goal to continue to grow 150 basis points more than Industrial Production Index over the cycle, that our segment operating margins will reach 19%, that our EBITDA margin will reach 20%, that we'll continue to generate free cash flow greater than net income over the cycle and all of that will result in earnings per share growth of 10% or more a year. We measure ourselves in this with a goal of wanting to grow 150 basis points faster than the Industrial Production Index over the cycle.	Transcript
PH.N	2023-05-04T11:00:00Z	EBIT			We now are forecasting 22.5% for the full year. When you look at adjusted segment operating margins, we've increased our full year guide by 40 basis points.	Transcript
NSC.N	2023-01-25T08:45:00Z	Revenue			You can expect in 2023 that the quarterly year-over-year growth will be around double what you see here, meaning that the full year impact will be a step-up in the $40 million to $50 million range.	Transcript
MSFT.OQ	2023-02-07T17:30:00Z	Revenue			Simply put, the new Bing and the new Edge will drive revenue growth through increased volume and increased rates.	Transcript
MSFT.OQ	2023-01-24T17:30:00Z	EBIT			As a result, when excluding the Q2 charge and favorable impact from the change in accounting estimate, we expect full year operating margins to be down roughly 1 point in constant currency and roughly 2 points in USD, even with the headwinds from materially lower OEM revenue and higher energy costs.	Transcript
MSFT.OQ	2022-10-25T17:30:00Z	EBIT			At the total company level, we continue to expect double-digit revenue and operating income growth on a constant currency basis.	Transcript
HWM.N	2023-05-02T10:00:00Z	EBITDA	6325000000	6200000000	The balance sheet was improved with debt reductions of $176 million, and net leverage will now continue towards the 2x net debt to EBITDA in the balance of 2023, given both the reduction in debt and the improved EBITDA.	Transcript
HWM.N	2023-05-02T10:00:00Z	Revenue	1435000000	1400000000	So I don't think you should be expecting anything, given what has been a really, really great first quarter, maybe I shouldn't say it myself, but it was good.	Transcript
HWM.N	2023-02-14T10:00:00Z	EBIT			We look forward to above-trend growth in '23, '24 and '25, and that will be reflected in additional profits and cash coming from the business.	Transcript

BAX.N	2022-09-14T10:35:00Z	Revenue	2442260800	2266950000	But I was listening to a competitor yesterday talk about just significant pent-up demand in this market, given some of the issues that have happened in infusion pumps over the last couple of years. Maybe just to move over to NOVUM for a moment, but you got the syringe pump approval, and the large volume pump is expected in 2023. So for me, I look at it and say, sure, there could be some short-term pent-up of demand that we're able to support. What I would say in general is we would expect overall infusion pump sales next year of the LVP to be north of $100 million.	Transcript
BAX.N	2022-06-14T13:40:00Z	EBIT			And again, you also have the Hillrom synergies in there, but it's a lot of, I realize, change. I want to kind of transition this to just talking about margins and margin aspirations.	Transcript

These changes reflect the removal of the Employer Group commercial medical business results, which are being adjusted out for non-GAAP reporting purposes, partially offset by the impact of our previously announced increased individual Medicare Advantage membership growth estimates for the full year of at least 775,000 members.

GE.N	2022-07-26T08:00:00Z	Revenue			And perhaps stating the obvious, with so much in flux right now, around the world, I think it's going to be important for us to see how the next 6 months unfold and at this point, expect to provide an outlook on '23 in the usual time frame at earnings -- at fourth quarter earnings. And we do expect earnings to be a bigger contributor in the sort of the 2023 improvement. It will start off a lower 2022 base, but it will still be the main part of improvement for 2023. So what that means basically is that we still expect to see the same drivers as we shared in March, but we're monitoring the volatility as Larry spoke about. We still expect to deliver significant year-over-year improvement in both profit and cash, but below our prior view. We're just starting our annual strategy and budgeting cycle for 2023. With the world evolving so quickly, we have to see how the next 6 months unfold and expect to provide you our 2023 outlook in the usual time frame at fourth quarter earnings. Yes.	Transcript

WFC.N	2023-01-13T12:00:00Z	Revenue			And just looking at what the guide implies a step down -- a little bit of a step down from thereafter. And so as you look at the key things, you look at stick loan growth, we've got -- we're expecting kind of low to mid-single-digit loan growth throughout the year. And then obviously, also the timing of when we expect to realize some of those matters as well. And then we would expect the betas to continue to move up a little from here. Can you just kind of walk us through just how you expect the betas to move through and then like what doesn't necessarily follow through from here in terms of some of the moving parts? However, this benefit is expected to be partially offset by continued deposit runoff and mix shift to higher-yielding products with these declines, partially offset by modest loan growth. Mike, just a follow-up on the NII outlook for the year. So not super fast pace, but at a moderate pace of loan growth. So you obviously had a good high end to the year at 13.5% FTE. This reduction is expected to be partially offset by an increase in trading gains and noninterest income, so the impact to revenue is currently expected to be small. We also expect a headwind for lower CIB Markets net interest income due to higher funding costs. We are expecting some moderate declines across the deposit base, stabilizing later in the year, but some moderate declines as we look over the next few quarters.	Transcript

And we believe that, that will enable us to grow rate base in the range of 8% to 9% on a compound annual growth rate basis, assuming all of the investments that were anticipated in the settlement agreement, ultimately, we're able to successfully bring into service. Feel free to opine any more on the '25 guidance. For customers in Northwest Florida, typical customer bills are projected to decline over the next 4 years. I know that this is probably preempting a little bit the June Analyst Day, regardless. I know there's been a lot of back and forth, and perhaps there's a lot of context to provide there. I would say the key parts that we think about, first on Florida Power & Light Company, we've got the outcome from the 4-year settlement agreement. So we can continue that for the next couple of years. That is now the -- how we expect to operate for the next couple of years, and that creates the opportunity to continue investing in the business and executing on the strategy that's been so successful for customers over quite a number of years looking back.

XLNX.OQ^B22	2020-06-15T12:00:00Z	EBIT			And I think the ability to leverage the work that we've done so far on 7-nanometer in the next few years will allow us to pursue that and then that will allow growth in the top line of the company to normalize the level of spending that we have in the business. And more recently, they had jumped up into the high 20s, low 30s. And so we do not expect -- even if some of the end markets that we pursue have different margin structures than the end markets that we've had over time, we did not expect to have a decline in the operating margin environment relative to where Xilinx has been in the past. And then lastly, on the operating model, the operating margins 10 years ago, they were in kind of in the low 20s. And then we expect to be able to leverage that platform through multiple families and derivatives over time. I'll just kind of double-click on what I said earlier. Long term, is Xilinx a high 20s, low 30s operating margin company or a mid-20s, like where we are right now? So that's our goal and our target. This last fiscal year, understandably, due to lower top line expectations for some of the macro events, they kind of dropped into the 26% range. We're in the front end of the 7-nanometer development phase. Yes, keyword there being long-term as we work through this equation.	Transcript

HPE.N	2022-11-29T17:00:00Z	EBIT			In HPC & AI, revenue fell 11% year-over-year solely as a result of the Frontier deal slipping into fiscal year '23, which also impacted our operating margin in this segment. Our operating margin of 13.3% was up 2.4% annually, though down 3.2% sequentially with FX being the biggest contributor to the sequential decline. We are on track to close that deal in Q1 and have factored that into our guidance. We continue to expect our Edge business to grow and perform like a Rule of 40 business moving forward.

I know there was some benefit of hold in the quarter, but would you say you're fully ramped in terms of where you need to be and there should be a lot of leverage as we go forward? I think last time you guys talked about high-20s as an exit rate for this year, but it seems like we're tracking above that. Or is there additional head count that you'd look to add? So in the second half of this year, I think that the labor costs will increase because we have to fill some vacancies to address service issues.	Transcript

The combined market impact in '22 and '23 is expected to reduce Equifax revenue by over $900 million.	Transcript
EFX.N	2023-04-20T08:30:00Z	EBITDA			Adjusting for the incremental stock-based compensation expense incurred in the quarter, adjusted EBITDA margins would have been approximately 31%, which is the baseline of which we expect to grow to 36% in the fourth quarter from revenue growth and our $120 million cost savings plan. Also, we'll be making certain forward-looking statements, including second quarter and full year 2023 guidance, to help you understand Equifax and its business environment (inaudible). And we're executing against our spending reduction plans that will deliver $200 million of savings in 2023 with run rate savings of over $250 million in 2024 that will expand our margins to 36% and EPS to over $2 per share as we exit the year, which positions us for an uncertain economic environment while reducing the capital intensity of our business. We also continue to expect to deliver adjusted EBITDA margins of over 36% in the fourth quarter, which is a very important stepping-off point for 2024.	Transcript

DHR.N	2023-04-25T08:00:00Z	EBIT			Additionally, we expect a full year adjusted operating profit margin of approximately 30%, which reflects the previously mentioned efforts to adjust our cost structure and capacity in response to COVID-19 transitioning to an endemic state.	Transcript
DHR.N	2022-01-11T11:15:00Z	EBIT			And then also, you're shifting of production as you move away from COVID eventually? As we think about kind of margins beyond 2022, how do you think about kind of unaffected margins post-COVID? As we think about margin profiles here, Tycho, we've been running at higher levels of margin profiles, certainly from a mix perspective and a volume perspective, but also because operating costs just haven't been what they were historically in relation to the lack of travel and conferences and so forth. But we used to run at about 30% to 35% VCM. So we don't believe that those variable contribution margins are going to sustain at these very high rates. We do think that we're going to be at a higher VCM here between the 35% and 40% for the long term. We have been higher than that at 40%, 45%, sometimes even a little higher.	Transcript
DHR.N	2023-01-10T16:30:00Z	EBITDA			And on the right, you'll see our anticipated long-term performance of mid-single-digit core revenue growth, recurring revenues of over 50% and adjusted EBITDA margins of 25% with very strong cash flow.	Transcript
DHR.N	2022-07-21T08:00:00Z	EBITDA			But if we don't have any extra new headwinds that show up, I just think the normal VCM of 35% to 40% is the place to be.	Transcript

They're everywhere in our business, but I think show up pretty quickly in the defense businesses just given the accounting models that we use for revenue recognition. We don't want to talk about '23, but I'll ask about '25 because you guys put out your targets and just maybe how this is mapping to that. Yes, that will just keep going up.	Transcript
RTX.N	2023-04-25T08:30:00Z	EBIT			Looking ahead, on a full year basis, we continue to expect Collins' sales to grow low double digits and operating profit of between $750 million and $825 million increase versus 2022.	Transcript

MRO.N	2023-02-16T09:00:00Z	EBITDA			For 2023, we expect equity income and EBITDA to decline largely due to assume significantly lower commodity prices, especially for natural gas and the already referenced planned turnaround during the second quarter. The outlook beyond 2023, however, is robust as we expect to realize significant EG earnings and cash flow improvement in 2024 on the back of an increase in our global LNG price exposure.	Transcript
MRO.N	2022-11-03T09:00:00Z	EBITDA			The cash consideration paid for the asset is attractive at just 3.4x 2023 EBITDA with a 17% 2023 free cash flow yield, highly accretive relative to Marathon Oil's stand-alone metrics at the same price deck.	Transcript
ADM.N	2022-05-18T09:30:00Z	EBITDA			And already in the first quarter, we upgraded the guidance to 20%. And we have settled to say long term, we're going to grow 15%. And you need to continue to grow EBITDA margin on sales, and they have done that. So you've seen OP growth year-over-year of 30% to 40%.	Transcript
ADM.N	2023-01-26T09:00:00Z	Revenue			I want to take a moment to expand on our view of Nutrition in 2023. Nutrition is expected to continue on a positive growth trajectory for full year 2023, including 10-plus percent profit growth and a similar level of revenue growth. Resilient food demand should drive higher volumes and margins in starches, sweeteners and wheat milling. We see continued strong demand for ethanol, including positive discretionary blending economics.	Transcript
ADM.N	2023-04-25T09:00:00Z	Revenue			As noted, we expect this growth to be significantly weighted to the back half of the year, as we manage through some destocking impacts in beverage, lower margins in amino acids and the broader demand fulfillment challenges, we discussed in the last quarter. Nutrition's growth trajectory for the year remains on course with a double-digit increase in our human Nutrition pipeline compared to this point in 2022.	Transcript
ADM.N	2023-05-17T09:30:00Z	EBIT			I guess for us, when we look at it very closely, there's a lot of volatility through the year in the markets and the operating environment. We remain confident that the growth will be back half loaded. We've guided that, that business should generate 10% growth for this full year.	Transcript
ADM.N	2022-09-07T15:45:00Z	EBIT			Again, as you said, we put a goal out there to make $1 billion in operating profit and we are again thinking that we're going to deliver that next year. And if you also could elaborate a little bit on some of the most recent partnerships and agreements, Benson Hill, New Culture and how they're going to play a role within nutrition to get this beyond $1 billion? Now one of the other things and you've also had in your operating remarks, obviously, the nutrition business and all the investments into human as well as animal nutrition, it's now, I think, you said three quarters of a billion. So definitely on track to get to the $1 billion that you've once laid out a few years back. Yes. Listen, it's been an incredible journey, the creation of this Nutrition division.	Transcript

CLX.N	2022-08-03T17:00:00Z	Revenue	7249140000	7178070000	So we have to lap that in addition to some moderating consumer behaviors.	Transcript
CLX.N	2023-05-02T17:00:00Z	Revenue			Actually, it's a good lead in. Based on our strong performance, we're raising our fiscal year outlook. Just in response to, I think, to Lauren's question earlier on volume growth, Kevin, your response, if I heard it correctly, you emphasized stabilization of volumes. Maybe it's a progression over the course of '24, but just -- so I don't walk away with the wrong impression.	Transcript
CLX.N	2023-05-02T17:00:00Z	Revenue			But if it delivers below our expectations, I think that would be a reason why we'd be towards the lower end of the range for the fourth quarter. So my question refers more on the quarter coming in better than anticipated. You called out Kingsford being one that you potentially have to work out the price gaps.	Transcript
CLX.N	2023-02-23T14:00:00Z	EBIT			Now in terms of EBIT margin, we have not delivered on our goal. So to your point, Jason, as we rebuild that I'd expect to see accelerated EBIT margin expansion until we get back to a more normalized P&L and then get back to that more normal cadence of 25 to 50 bps. The financial goals we've set is to grow top line 3% to 5%, expand EBIT margins annually 25 to 50 basis points and then continue to generate very strong cash flow, which we define as 11% to 13% of sales. This year looks like it's a year where you're going to exceed the long-term target on the recovery. We have seen margins contract over the last year specifically. We've taken multiple rounds of pricing, including our most recent round we just took in December.	Transcript

DOV.N	2023-05-09T08:00:00Z	EBIT			And then we would expect the headwinds that we had, from a comp point of view for that to dissipate in the second half. It seems like, this year, your second half margins are expected to be, call it, 100 to 150 basis points better than your first half margins. Last few years have been pretty tremendous, right? So arguably, we've had a little bit of a head start here. We feel good that -- we were talking about inventory drawdown in biopharma a year before anybody else was. We'll see how much that picks up, but we would expect that to sequentially increase with, hopefully, a really good '24 coming our way.	Transcript

DOV.N	2022-11-08T08:55:00Z	Revenue			I mean, what do you think is structurally different at Dover now versus, say, the pre-COVID era? Maybe one last question around this. Well, I mean, I can't -- I don't think it's worth talking about pre-2018, not just because I became the CEO then, but that was the period when Dover had a much larger exposure to oil and gas, which, as we know, highly cyclical.	Transcript
MTB.N	2023-04-17T11:00:00Z	Revenue			And based on where the first quarter loan balances ended, just the averaging effect of that should carry a little bit of growth through the second quarter. And really, the -- I think the challenge that you're seeing is pipelines have been robust, but they're starting to slow down a little bit, and we're managing them to focus our liquidity on our best customers and our relationship customers. And then we expect things to kind of flatten out a little bit as we go through the back half of the year.	Transcript

Turning to expenses. We continue to expect deposit mix to shift toward higher cost deposits with declines expected in demand deposits and growth in time deposits as well as on balance sheet sweeps. We expect service charges on deposit accounts to be 3% to 6% higher than 2022 and anticipate trust income to be 8% to 10% higher in 2023.	Transcript
FDX.N	2022-12-20T17:30:00Z	Revenue			As we look to the second half of the year, we expect volume declines to begin moderating in Express and Ground by the end of the third quarter with comparisons easing further in the fourth quarter as we lap the onset of softer volumes.	Transcript
FDX.N	2023-03-16T17:30:00Z	Revenue			And actually, when we're thinking about Express, we think that trend will continue into Q1 as well.	Transcript
FDX.N	2022-06-23T17:00:00Z	EBIT			And kind of the cadence of what we should expect over the course of fiscal '23 for this segment as the margin expansion has been nothing short of impressive 500 basis points plus quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. So that was certainly most prevalent in the first half of the year.	Transcript

IPG.N	2023-04-27T08:30:00Z	EBIT			As indicated earlier, we remain comfortable with our growth outlook for the year, along with our expectation for margin expansion. As we continue to evolve the portfolio and transform our businesses, we expect severance will remain elevated in our second quarter and that we will increasingly see the benefits of these actions on margins as we move forward through the year. Is there any upside to EBITA margin guidance? You beat our estimate on operating margin, I think, probably ahead of what you were kind of pointing people towards.	Transcript

First, from an overall margin standpoint, you're right. So we were in the high 20s in the last couple of years, 25%, 26%, 27%; right in line to hit that $3.5 billion for 2025; and in good shape to hit $10 billion for the overall merchant segment by '25. That's now up and running; and will provide growth for us in '23, '24 and beyond. We continue to have great opportunities in the international space, again both from a Clover standpoint as well as overall merchant.	Transcript

But we did say, without a mild recession, we thought about the opportunity to be at minimum on the high end, if not, do something else. Just touch on the assumptions you built into that again. Putting it all together, when we think about the guidance you gave, I mean, I think it was 7% to 9% organic revenue growth, 20 -- 12% to 14% EPS growth, right? We weren't battening down the hatches and preparing for offense.	Transcript
CSCO.OQ	2022-08-24T12:00:00Z	Revenue	56970485000	56712100000	And I think customers are seeing the benefit of that operationally as well as economically. And I think that's the area for very significant growth going forward. And so I think that will be a very significant growth driver for the business going forward. And that has also, I think, grown along with our expectations, in line with our expectations. But can you give us a quick update on how Acacia is doing, especially tell us a little bit about what you guys are seeing in China? I guess, Acacia is doing really well because Chuck has highlighted Acacia on the last 4 earnings call. I think it was a very big move for Cisco to decide we're going to support that segment of the business, and it's helped us to make sure that we meet the commitments to Cisco. Now switching topics to the optical side or the coherent side of the business. So things must be going great. The other important assumption was that we're going to grow the Cisco piece of that business as well through things like routed optical networking and adoption of pluggable ZR and ZR+ pluggables into our routers. We do expect to influence customers around this routed optical networking architecture.	Transcript

WTW's operations in Russia, which were almost entirely within our Risk and Broking segment, comprised approximately 1% of consolidated revenue for 2021 and were highly profitable.

WTW.OQ	2022-04-26T07:00:00Z	Revenue			Overall, our outlook for Risk and Broking remains positive with mid-single-digit revenue growth expected over the longer term. We continue to expect that the actions we have taken will enable us to narrow the growth gap over the course of the year, with pace accelerating in the second half of 2022 as the impacts of our actions build and headwinds subside.

CTAS.OQ	2022-09-28T10:00:00Z	EBITDA			But basically, what type of expenses have you been able to adjust so that you can stay at this mid-20s EBITDA level. If I look back about 2 years ago, your EBITDA margin like really meaningfully stepped up to mid-20s. We think it's very, very important, which gives us an advantage in the marketplace. You see that -- certainly, energy is a big subject today, but we've talked about our smart truck proprietary routing technology that's helping us reduce idle time and drive time, which obviously helps with our energy spend, but it helps with CO2 emissions as well. You've really been able to keep it at that level.	Transcript
GPN.N	2023-05-01T08:00:00Z	EBITDA	8735000000	8635000000	I'm pleased to report that we currently have executable plans to achieve the run rate EBITDA synergy target of at least $125 million within 2 years that we committed to at the time of the announcement.	Transcript
GPN.N	2023-05-01T08:00:00Z	Revenue			We are pleased with how our business is positioned following our first quarter performance, and we are raising our financial outlook for the year. We now expect reported adjusted net revenue to range from $8.635 billion to $8.735 billion, reflecting growth of 7% to 8% over 2022, an increase from 6% to 7% previously.	Transcript
GPN.N	2023-05-16T11:00:00Z	Revenue			And I expect the vast majority next year would be kind of GAAP earnings. And so why don't we come back to that because with the acquisitions and divestitures in those last couple of years, the free cash flow and sort of GAAP versus non-GAAP earnings profile of Global Payments has taken a little bit of a hit. And that reflects the 3 things that we announced last year that just closed this year. And we, by and large, expect to hit that guidance this year ex selling that spend, which is -- we said it's like 4 to 5 points. How should investors think about now that you've completed the transactions you were off the pandemic. I expect that to continue to trend up because we don't expect to do meaningful deals in the immediate term. It was our expectation this year and revenues high single digits. So I think we're in a good place. So as we look forward, what is your outlook or how do you think about the role of improving those 2 measures? The first thing is merchants should grow at 10%, 11%, 12%. This year, it's going to be close to 16% is what we said because we've got the EVO thing coming in but EVO is growing on its own organically low double digits, right? When you think about the building box post these acquisitions and dispositions, merchants 3/4 of the company and issuer B2B is 25% of the company.	Transcript
GPN.N	2023-02-10T08:00:00Z	EBIT			Finally, while the disposition of our Consumer Solutions business is naturally expected to be a headwind for the full year, this transaction enhances the overall growth and adjusted operating margin profile of the business going forward. First, while we expect foreign exchange rates to be roughly neutral for the full year, we anticipate the currency headwind to adjusted net revenue of up to 200 basis points in the first quarter and a headwind of up to 100 basis points in the second quarter. In terms of quarterly phasing, there are several items to note. We anticipate adjusted operating margin for the Issuer business to expand up to 60 basis points as we continue to benefit from operating leverage in the business as growth continues to accelerate, offset somewhat by faster growth in our lower-margin B2B businesses.	Transcript
GPN.N	2023-05-01T08:00:00Z	EBIT			We anticipate this impact to be mitigated by synergy realization as the year progresses. We continue to expect more than 100 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion from the existing Global Payments merchant business excluding dispositions in 2023, which again is ahead of our cycle guide. We expect this expansion will be more than offset beginning in the second quarter with the absorption of the lower-margin profile of EVO Payments.	Transcript

WMT.N	2023-02-21T08:00:00Z	EBIT			And it's good to speak with you. But again, I would just point you to the fact that there's just a lot that we don't know. But as noted, our business composition, or the things like our initiatives, advertising, Walmart fulfillment services, those are contributing to a larger share of our overall business, which has less of an impact as we look at this fiscal year. So the EBIT structure related to the U.S. business, there's a couple of factors there.	Transcript
WMT.N	2023-04-05T09:00:00Z	EBIT			So it's kind of how we think about that.	Transcript

XRAY.OQ	2022-05-10T08:30:00Z	EBIT			And when we get to '23 guidance, we'll articulate it then. In my opinion, it is only sort of modestly stepping down, especially with the 8% of the sales in China and Russia, but the OI is much more impacted in the big decline year-over-year. Maybe I'll go back to the 2022 revenue outlook. So we'll certainly provide updated guidance for '23 when we get to the end of the year. There's obviously a lot of moving pieces in the macro right now that everyone is dealing with, and we're no different. We expect to end the year at around 20% op margin as we mentioned earlier.

EQR.N	2023-02-10T11:00:00Z	Revenue			And if you put kind of all of that into the blender and you think about like 2023 and our expectations, right now in our portfolio, we kind of normalized concessions to the 2022 level so we expect to continue to see some elevated concessions in the shoulder periods. As Michael mentioned, the midpoint of our same-store revenue guidance assumes a 90-basis point reduction in revenue growth due to the impact of bad debt. The contribution of this blended rate growth to revenue will be approximately half as we capture it over the 2023 leasing season.	Transcript

In fiscal '22, Express Lane drove approximately 25% of total NIKE Brand revenue with higher profitability. We expect to benefit from mid-single-digit pricing actions and continued gains from our shift to a more direct business, offset by another 100 basis points headwind from elevated ocean freight costs, increased product costs, discrete supply chain investments and normalization of historically low markdown rates.

WYNN.OQ	2023-05-09T16:30:00Z	Revenue			Looking forward, as you have seen, market-wide GGR momentum in Macau has been very impressive, building through the first quarter and accelerating into April.

WYNN.OQ	2023-05-09T16:30:00Z	EBITDA			And then just in terms of Macau, I know there was a couple of moving pieces in the quarter. But just as we think about this going forward and over the next few years, that would be helpful. Got it. I've talked a bit about this on prior calls. Is there any way to maybe quantify -- and I recognize that this is not something you would typically adjust for, but that mass hold in the quarter in terms of the impact to EBITDA as well as that construction disruption and just as we kind of think about in a normalized scenario going forward, that would be helpful. So we think that this will be a healthy balance of gaming-nongaming and that, that will allow us to provide a very full and high-quality experience and generate very healthy returns. Yes. Sure.

PSA.N	2022-11-02T12:00:00Z	Revenue			And frankly, move-ins were quite strong in the quarter with move-in volumes were up 9%, move-in rates were up 3%. And so that's what I'd point you to. But as we look forward from here, our guidance would imply that we will exit the year with revenue growing at, call it, 10%, plus or minus, which sets us up really well heading into 2023. But that 3% is clearly a moderation from where we were earlier in the year and would anticipate that to continue to moderate through the fourth quarter. Just like how long do you have visibility into elevated rent growth? Like how long would you have visibility into kind of continued elevated realized rent growth just based on these factors and not like some of the other things like with a worsening of or any potential worsening of street rates or any of that? Recognizing it could be an uncertain environment into 2023, we'll be starting from a period of strength. So looking at what we're experiencing on move-in rent growth, we have seen the moderation in move-in rent growth as we move through the year that we've been anticipating and speaking to move-in rent growth.

I think from a margin perspective, really spend is focused on getting the U.S. approval, which we expect in '25. So I think as we talked about on the revenue headwind, we expect that to -- as the revenue improves throughout the year, we expect that margin impact to lessen throughout the year, certainly, and hopefully, as we exit Q4, we're more at a normalized state. So less focus on margin improvement for that business in the near term, that will be more when it's available in the U.S.	Transcript

As a reminder, the fourth quarter of fiscal '24 contains an extra week. Furthermore, when using fiscal '20 as a comparison, you will see that our guidance implies revenue trends will further soften in the second quarter. Our guide implies comparable sales trends versus last year improve as we progress through the year. Starting with revenue, we expect Enterprise revenue in the range of $43.8 million to $45.2 billion and Enterprise comparable sales decline of 3% to 6%.	Transcript

First, this $250 million to $300 million annual impact is net of reinvestments that are targeted to strengthen our innovation pipeline, expand our commercial efforts across key products, customers and regions, deepen our technology and digital capabilities and strengthen our talent. In total, the combined programs are targeting a preliminary net annualized P&L impact of $250 million to $300 million that we expect to be achieved between 2023 and 2025. Secondly, the net savings will be slightly more skewed to 2024 and 2025. The third initiative is our economic profit team that is focused on leveraging improved technology and disciplined processes to optimize product mix, rationalize SKUs and enhance make versus buy decisions. We look forward to sharing more details with you at our Investor Day in December.	Transcript

IFF.N	2021-01-11T06:55:00Z	EBIT			That's up around 400 basis points from our 2020 pro forma. We also expect to see meaningful operating margin improvement for IFF moving forward, including an estimated adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 26% in 2023.	Transcript

JCI.N	2023-02-01T08:30:00Z	Revenue			Our backlog grew double digits and remains at record level. We were pleased with our start of the year and are encouraged by the continued strength and resilience in our order and backlog.	Transcript
JCI.N	2023-05-09T10:30:00Z	Revenue			And then just how significant is the delta between the margin profile of what's in backlog versus what's flowing through revenue now we would assume the long cycle component has more price/cost benefits just because of the lag on inflationary pricing. Correct. It's now growing 10%. So if you look at -- let me give you the elements to enter the answer. Talk to us about that, talk to us about mix. The inflection point is going to be driven by the 2 points we mentioned earlier. The margin on orders on install is increasing sequentially every quarter.	Transcript

KEY.N	2023-04-20T10:00:00Z	Revenue			And importantly, most of this growth has already occurred relative to 2022, so we don't expect material loan balance growth. And to your point, there's no question that the cost of raw material has gone up significantly. But as you and I have talked before, lending on a stand-alone business that's hard to return your cost of capital. Slide 18 updates our full year 2023 outlook. So I'm trying to reconcile you are more caution with your provisions with no change in your loan guidance whereas others have brought down their loan guidance that they tightened things up. The guidance is relative to our full year 2022 results. We expect average loans to grow between 6% and 9%. We're certainly not going to change our lending standards.	Transcript

GIS.N	2022-06-15T10:00:00Z	Revenue			And it's added over 1 point of growth for context. And our free cash flow conversion has been really, really good over the last number of years. And then to the extent that we need to shedding assets where somebody else is probably a better owner than we are and they're dilutive to our current growth. And within that model, we want to make sure that we're investing in activities that can help us achieve that model and generate the free cash flow that is necessary.	Transcript

GIS.N	2022-06-15T10:00:00Z	EBIT			And our free cash flow conversion has been really, really good over the last number of years. And the key is to make sure we're investing in some areas while deprioritizing others. And then combine that with the dividend, you get a really good return for shareholders. And within that model, we want to make sure that we're investing in activities that can help us achieve that model and generate the free cash flow that is necessary. But in the current environment, how is the company generally balancing investment needs to support growth strategy versus -- and I know you discussed those sustained, those are still being prioritized, but what's the process by which you balance those strategic investments with the need to deliver bottom line and free cash flow? It's actually invest to generate a return and then sometimes quitting activities that aren't generating the returns that we want in order to do things more like data and analytics that we think are going to be more important to us. So as I mentioned in the opening, you're in your quiet period, so we'll recognize that. So it's not just spend more, spend more, spend more. So that is our model. So yes, again, without giving guidance on next year, what I would say over the longer term, our -- we've been very clear that in our sales guidance growth is 2% to 3% inflationary period notwithstanding, which can lead to -- which leads to mid-single-digit operating profit growth and mid- to high single-digit EPS growth.	Transcript
GIS.N	2022-09-21T08:00:00Z	EBIT			As price-mix on the business outside of bakery flour did not keep pace with roughly 20% input cost inflation for the segment in Q1, we expect recent incremental SRM actions will help address this gap and improve our profit performance in the remainder of the year. Segment operating profit for the quarter was down 25%.	Transcript
GIS.N	2022-06-29T07:30:00Z	EBIT			And when looking at our performance compared to prepandemic levels in fiscal '19, our results are in line with or ahead of our long-term growth goals, including mid-single-digit growth in organic net sales and adjusted operating profit and high single-digit growth in adjusted diluted EPS. On the bottom line, though our gross and operating margins were below prior year levels, we were able to deliver constant currency growth of 2% on adjusted operating profit and 4% on adjusted diluted EPS.

It certainly has peaks and troughs and it starts to peak, we see, during the winter months, but we also see that it continues to be with us year-round. So in terms of the COMIRNATY portion of combos and sort of moving forward, I think obviously, time is going to tell as the sort of the virus continues to evolve. Thanks for the question. That's excluding COVID-19 products and excluding the impact of FX.	Transcript

The forecast reflects SCE's current view of the request to be made in GRC track 4, the 2025 GRC and other applications. We continue to see strong potential for SCE to continue deploying capital and achieving 7% to 9% rate base growth through 2025.	Transcript

NWS.OQ	2023-02-09T17:00:00Z	EBIT			Profitability will be skewed to the fourth quarter as we expect third quarter cost to be higher in local currency compared to the prior year given the contractual escalators and expanded content from the AFL and NRL. We are very encouraged by the year-to-date performance and continue to expect the Foxtel Group's profitability in local currency for the full year to be relatively stable.	Transcript

TYL.N	2023-04-27T10:00:00Z	Revenue			And it's the same thing with flips from on-prem to the cloud. Any context you can provide, just around your view on that number is helpful. The commentary around the demand environment, RFP volume has remained consistently upbeat. There's -- we may sign it now, but there's a period of time where that transition takes place, so we don't get the uplift in the revenues immediately. What is the organic growth number not entirely reflecting relative to the demand backdrop, whether it's pipeline bookings or just general mix and transition impacts?	Transcript
TYL.N	2022-11-30T12:20:00Z	EBITDA			But what are some of the things that should be top of mind for investors as we're thinking through the growth margin profile near term, and then we can go into the longer term.	Transcript
TYL.N	2022-11-29T12:15:00Z	EBIT			And we've got some duplicate costs until we get out of -- completely out of our first data center and then our second data center over the next 2 to 3 years that are sort of elevating our cost right now. But we did say that for a number of reasons as we came into this year, we expected to see more of a margin -- more pressure on margins. So -- and maybe when we're talking about that, maybe we can also discuss how government customers and the typical traditional enterprise customers differ, right? So -- and then the bubble costs as well. So are you guys currently on track with 290 basis points of impact to FY '22 margins?	Transcript
TYL.N	2023-04-27T10:00:00Z	EBIT			And certainly, margins and our targets and broadly how we view the trajectory of one of the topics we'll be looking to address at the Investor Day, that things are rarely linear. And then the other question is, I know that you guys have been messaging about operating margins, troughing in 2022 before they expand in 2024. And then, in terms of the overall margin, we don't give quarterly guidance, so we didn't have a quarterly margin target out there. But generally, our expectation for the full year margins hasn't changed. So, I don't expect it to be linear. The first quarter did have good performance, good growth around the subscription revenues, as some of those revenues are coming online from deals we've signed in prior quarters and the pace at which those revenues hit can affect that somewhat.

BAC.N						
KMX.N	2022-04-12T09:00:00Z	Revenue			During our Analyst Day last May, we announced long-term targets of achieving 2 million combined retail and wholesale units sold and $33 billion of revenue in FY '26, up from $1.2 million and $19 billion, respectively, during FY '21. These ranges reflect the macro factors we [had] earlier that could result in ongoing volatility in consumer demand and vehicle pricing. Though we don't anticipate updating our targets annually, our strong performance in FY '22 has given us a new perspective on these targets that we believe is appropriate to share at this time. We're revising our FY '26 targets to reflect a range of 2 million to 2.4 million combined units with revenue between $33 billion and $45 billion.	Transcript
PARA.OQ	2023-02-16T08:30:00Z	EBITDA			And then on the Filmed Entertainment segment, we do expect slightly lower OIBDA on a year-over-year basis there, just given the timing of our film slate, which is a little more back-end loaded in '23 relative to '22. And then, of course, we're comping against '22, which included Top Gun, which was obviously a very large contributor. I think TV Media will also reflect the impact of a number of the cost savings initiatives that we started talking about on our last call as well as some of the benefits that we'll unlock from Showtime and Paramount+ in the back part of the year. Importantly, our focus on working capital optimization meant the year-over-year change in free cash flow in 2022 was better than the year-over-year change in OIBDA, a trend we expect will continue in 2023 as the gap between cash content spend and P&L content expense continues to narrow.

Given these investments, we forecast D2C OIBDA losses will be greatest in 2023, but will improve in 2024 when our global D2C businesses will start to see the benefits of our full content slate, including Paramount Pay1 movies.

Starting with our established market-leading businesses.	Transcript

And going through that margin to actually through sort of 2024, we'll continue to assess it for the long term. And this is probably a good time to weave in a question from the audience here. But again, when I think about top line growth, the operating leverage of that continues to provide. But in that Investor Day outlook, you pointed to low 30s, 31%, 32% operating margin by 2024. Is that the right end state for eBay? It frees up capacity for us to continue to invest in the business and then to continue to stimulate earnings growth at the bottom line. Or is that just a stepping stone given the reinvestment -- priority right now? So I'm very happy with the architecture that we laid out and very optimistic about the future potential for the company. We've really clearly laid out an architecture for the next couple of years. Yes, I'm not going to get ahead of myself.	Transcript

I think we will lap some of that exceptional growth, and that will probably serve as a bit of an offset in the later part of 2023. Now we will also continue to expect to see our cloud expenses grow as we integrate new data sets as we develop new solutions.

VRSK.OQ	2022-12-07T09:30:00Z	EBITDA			About half of it can be achieved by headcount-related actions that can include spans and layers and operating more efficiently. And then longer term, where should we -- how should we think about the margin for this business in sort of, let's say, 5 years' time? And then the final 25% comes from third-party spend, procurement efficiencies and real estate also in that bucket. And we are working through that. Another 1/4 of it comes from IT and tech-related spend, including some savings associated with our transition to the cloud. I think we said on our last earnings call that we have delivered actions. If you just change the track from growth to sort of margin now, you talked about 300 to 500 basis points of margin expansion, I think, by 2024. It can also include global optimization in where we hire and where we locate our talent that's both included in that 50%. So we think we have a good road to our target there. So what's left to be done? So yes, our margin targets of 300 to 500 basis points off of a 50% to 51% baseline, achieving those by 2024 is something that I am very committed to here as CFO. The timing of it being realized in our P&L will happen gradually from now through to 2024. We also gave some color on the buckets, the categories of spend action that we're looking there. We are almost halfway there. We've actioned over 50% of that.	Transcript

AMT.N	2023-02-23T08:30:00Z	Revenue			Lastly, as I mentioned in my earlier remarks, we anticipate a modest FX headwind of just under 1.5% to consolidated growth. Moving on to the details of Slide 7. At the midpoint of our outlook, we expect total property revenues of nearly $10.8 billion, representing growth of approximately 3% or approximately 4% absent the incremental reserves assumed for VIL in 2023. We also expect data centers to contribute roughly $55 million of growth in cash revenue to the property segment in 2023. We are guiding to approximately 4% organic tenant billings growth in 2023, including churn of around 4%, which is around 70 basis points lower than the 2022 churn rate.	Transcript
AMT.N	2022-03-14T09:35:00Z	Revenue			And we're seeing outsized escalators in Latin America. Because of the way it's contracted, we'll have very little churn, if any at all. But certainly, the long-term gross demand is going to be there. But the Indian government has stepped up and really have been much more supportive to the wireless segment, the telecom segment than it has in the past. But this year, we're looking at 9%, so really attractive. But we are seeing exactly what we expected to see. But we're seeing solid levels of gross growth, elevated churn because of a few -- just a few instances of churn there. It allowed the carriers to delay their interest and penalty fees on what we refer to adjusted gross revenue case that was in Europe, which is essentially a tax on adjusted gross revenue that goes back over a 15-year period. So Europe is really strong for us. So it helps them really shore up their balance sheet. So it's really good assets to build. So that really reduces the overall churn rate in that market at a time when we are seeing increased growth rates there. So that took a $7 billion liability off of Voda and basically delayed it for 4 years. So that's kind of where Latin America looks. So the escalators are jumping up into the upper single-digit rates in Latin America. So they are in the process of really kind of figuring that out. So we do think that, that market is turning a corner and turning a corner fairly rapidly. So we have the continuation of some of the Nextel churn coming through in Brazil. So we think Europe is really well positioned for many years of solid demand. So we think India is on the verge of some really good things. So we're excited about Europe. That is also because of a moderation in churn. That's a similar level to what we built in 2021. That's slightly down below where it was in 2021, down off of, I think, it was just under 8% in 2021. The churn rates are coming down to 5% or so in India, and we still see solid organic gross growth up in that 5% range as well, maybe a touch north of that. The integration is well in hand, and the growth rates look really strong across Europe. Then bouncing over to Latin America, we're going to see organic tenant billings growth rates in 2022 better than 6%. There are new entrants in Germany and some good activity around 4G densification and 5G deployment. There is less churn in the European market. There's more demand for these sites. They'll come, and they will go. They're also monetizing some of their noncore assets, which again will further strengthen their balance sheet. They're going to turn that into equity for the government and not pay it out. We are building 3,500, 3,600 sites in India in 2022. We couldn't be more happy with the acquisition we had done and the way that it's performing. We do think that will moderate and step back a little bit, so back into that 6% to 7% range by the time we get out to 2023. We have Telefonica kind of working through their MVNO strategy with AT&T in Mexico, so that's kind of delayed things there slightly. We think that, that they will get sure footing on their balance sheet, and they'll continue to build as well. We're going to be in positive territory for organic billings growth there in India for the first time in many years. We're happy to see them come back into positive territory for us when churn rates come down. We're projecting between 2% and 3% of organic tenant billings growth. We're still very cautious in terms of what we're projecting there.	Transcript

But right now, the carriers are really supporting that fixed wireless component element value proposition with additional infrastructure on our sites. I think if you're thinking about the opportunity at the edge, I still think that's a few years away. In the meantime, we're able to enjoy the kind of that interconnection cloud on-ramp rich marketplace. We're really looking to leverage the kind of that interconnection capability to really drive more value at that tower site that I talked about before that we have that exclusive right to be able to utilize. When we think about the data center business or why -- first of all, I think it's just a great infrastructure class.	Transcript

I'm going to do a quick one on margins. It again depends on, Dan, how quickly some of these things get traction. It's not a ton, but it's good enough to sort of get these initiatives started. Like when do you show that leverage? On the investment time horizon, we see over the next 2 to 3 years, significant investment, which is about -- in this case, if you do 50 basis points, it's for $15 million, $17 million. So I guess, how much -- how long do these reinvestments occur for? So if I were to compare apples-to-apples, yes, you should see margin expansion in 2025, '26, that time frame. So just one on margins. So you talked about 5% top line gets you north of 50 basis points, 50, 55 on operating margin, but you're investing. So you're showing less than that today.	Transcript

I'm not going to necessarily kind of guide here to '23 in terms of operating margins, but what I could tell you is I do feel good about, again, as I said before, the overall performance of the team in being able to ultimately drive our incrementals at that 25% plus kind of operating leverage that we talk about and then ultimately, also being able to protect the bottom line, if the case may be that demand does drop in certain areas. So margins have realized a pretty nice sequential improvement both over the last 2 quarters. What is the expectation on price cost into Q4 and early 2023 to the extent you have visibility on price in the backlog and where inventory costs are running at?	Transcript

HON.OQ	2023-04-27T08:30:00Z	Revenue			In Defense & Space, we passed the growth inflection point in 1Q, and we expect similar organic growth rates throughout the year as we convert our strong defense order book into sales. Looking ahead for Aerospace, demand across our end markets remain very encouraging. Now let's take a moment to walk through the second quarter and full year expectations by segment. Our expectation for the supply chain remains unchanged, modest, steady improvement each quarter. We expect modest sequential sales growth in the second quarter as flight hours continue to improve with particular strength in commercial aftermarket.	Transcript

So we think we're in the right position for higher growth and margin expansion over the next few years. The residential markets are running at high rates, and what normally have when you get towards the cycle that -- we've overbuilt the residential housing. This time, we're still chasing it. Usually, the economy, and the industry, keep growing as we start raising rates at this point. We believe there are going to be more acquisition opportunities. We think there's more going to come into the marketplace over the next year or 2. We're well positioned with our balance sheet to take advantage of those. We'll have to see how they evolve. We're talking to several at the moment. We've talked about the commercial improving. You hear us continuing to invest in leading technologies to give us differentiation to improve the margins.

CAT.N	2022-06-01T11:00:00Z	EBIT			Again, what we talk about is those adjusted operating profit margin targets, 300 to 600 basis points based on that reference period of 2010 to 2016. And the way we look at this is, we really don't talk about incremental margins quarter-to-quarter or year-to-year. Do you think you're going to be able to capture enough pricing this year to get you back to -- back on track to hitting your targets as we go into 2023? Having said that, we also, again, we see that our total addressable market is increasing. Okay. Our total addressable market is increasing, we'll maintain our margins, meet those margin targets, which should -- which will increase -- should increase our free cash flow (inaudible) to the top line. So at the Analyst Day a few weeks ago, you gave a guidance that implied incremental margins like the 30% to 40% range. So what we believe we will meet those targets this year, and we fully intend to meet them moving forward. We know we have to make increased investments in some products, but we believe, based on everything we see, again our intent is to invest more.	Transcript

That's why again, I don't ever want to lose share, but if the soup category continues to grow mid- to high single digits, and we may be pressured at over 50% of the category, even if we're pressured a little bit on share, the net of that is still a pretty strong positive for the company.

On the margins, my goal is to enhance margins over time, over the long term. So I guess I'm trying to get a little bit more depiction in my mind about what the kind of improvement curve looks like throughout the year as you slide south in 1Q and then build back, trying to get a sense of where you think like the exit rate is in '22 as a base case.

I mean, we are aiming for that and we will get back. I was wondering if you can give some insights on to what you think is needed based on your early analysis of the business there to return to historically what is more of a mid- to high teens margins or whether that target even looks realistic anymore. In KCP, we saw some sequential deterioration there, again despite the top line. Nelson, you commented on margins being a key focus of yours going forward.	Transcript

SWKS.OQ	2021-12-07T11:30:00Z	EBIT			And is that something that we can expect to be a tailwind for margins next year as some of those COVID-related costs hopefully start to abate? And one of the things that you've noted through the pandemic is you've taken on some additional cost to make sure that your customers were taken care of, and that's been a bit of a headwind to margins. And so we're excited about the opportunity as we're going forward. And the markets that we're in right now are the markets that you want to be in, they really are. And we think going into 2022, a lot of the stuff, a lot of these headwinds will abate. I'll pivot to margins a bit. The opportunity for us will continue to grow. When do those headwinds come off?

In addition, higher inflation and currency volatility, as well as promotions in certain markets to alleviate high stock levels more than offset our price increases and further pressured our business margins. Or should we think about there still being a mismatch between sell-in, sell and being down and sell through into the first quarter of '24. So I heard your comments on encouraging progression on share and retail sales turning positive in Hainan and so on. So the pace of retail, which has been slower, again, than we expected this year, will determine how quickly we resume shipments.	Transcript

So 25%, we still like over the long term. So let's see where the markets fall out on revenue growth, but long-term target we should get 25% incrementals.

STZ.N	2023-04-06T10:30:00Z	Revenue			We anticipate our full year fiscal '24 shipments and depletions to track each other closely, both on an absolute basis and in terms of the year-over-year comparison.	Transcript

STZ.N	2022-10-06T10:30:00Z	Revenue			So while on an absolute basis, we continue to expect our shipments for the remainder of this fiscal year to be relatively in line with depletions, we believe the more comparable indicator for growth for our beer brands in the second half will be the depletion rate.	Transcript
STZ.N	2022-10-06T10:30:00Z	EBIT			Looking forward, we are also confident that over the medium term, our Beer business remains well positioned to deliver 7% to 9% net sales growth and 39% to 40% operating margin, supported by the sustained momentum of our core brands, the steady progress of our brewing capacity additions and the continued development of our innovation lineup, including the momentum of our chelada brands, the recent launch of Fresca Mixed, the expansion of Modelo Oro from select test markets to the entire national market next year and the introduction of Corona nonalcoholic.

STZ.N	2023-01-05T10:30:00Z	EBIT			And in fact, when considering our fiscal '20 through our currently anticipated fiscal '24 margins, we expect the average operating margin for that 5-year period to remain within our medium-term algorithm of 39% to 40%.	Transcript
STZ.N	2023-04-06T10:30:00Z	EBIT			The majority of these relate to year-over-year adjustments in our packaging and raw material costs, which, on average, represent a high single-digit increase in absolute terms for these inputs in the import portion of our beer business.	Transcript
ABBV.N	2023-04-27T09:00:00Z	Revenue	52400000000	52400000000	And for aesthetics, we now expect global revenue of approximately $5.3 billion, reflecting the better-than-expected recovery in China and stable economic trends in the U.S. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a modest unfavorable impact on full year sales growth. First quarter results include continued robust performance from Skyrizi and Rinvoq, which remain on track to contribute more than $11 billion in combined sales this year. Longer term, we remain extremely confident in our ability to grow the aesthetics business and continue to expect to achieve total sales of more than $9 billion by the end of this decade. This guidance includes the following updated assumptions. We now expect Vraylar sales of approximately $2.7 billion, an increase of $200 million, reflecting strong prescription growth following the MDD approval. We now expect net revenues of approximately $52.4 billion, an increase of $400 million.	Transcript
ABBV.N	2023-03-15T13:35:00Z	EBIT	24440000000	24440000000	And that reduction is really driven by the fact we're continuing to invest in the business. I guess as we're going through the period now, what can you say about how you expect gross margins to evolve '23 and beyond. No, it's a fair question, especially in line of you said we've talked about operating margin and how we've seen we provided guidance of 47%, which is certainly a reduction from prior year. People are looking for those anchors.	Transcript
ABBV.N	2022-01-11T15:45:00Z	EBIT			And some of the prior margin comments you've made, do those still hold in terms of -- I don't know as you think about the investment seems to make in your business, can you manage those despite the '23 erosion you're expecting? And then as we return to growth very quickly, you'll start to see those operating margins expand once again. And what I've been saying is think of it in the 46% to 47% range as a trough level of operating margin, which still is top tier in our industry. We will see a decline in '23, given the U.S. Humira LOE.	Transcript

SWK.N	2022-05-12T13:00:00Z	Revenue	1700000000	1300000000	And we do think there's about a $300 million cyclical recovery revenue opportunity for this segment that plays out over some time frame in the next 2 to 4 years, depending on how quickly those industries recover. As we electrify those particular products over the next 3 to 5 years, we see that as a wonderful growth opportunity.	Transcript

SWK.N	2023-05-04T08:00:00Z	Revenue			If this scenario becomes the macro reality, we would expect full year organic revenues to decline by mid-single digits, with volume declines in both the Tools & Outdoor and industrial segments. The downside case reflects a deceleration of demand due to elevated recessionary pressures.	Transcript

HRL.N	2023-03-02T09:30:00Z	EBIT			We expect unfavorable mix in the retail segment, short-term margin compression due to our immediate actions across the supply chain and for continued COVID-related disruption in China to negatively affect the second quarter.	Transcript

TRMB.OQ	2023-05-03T08:00:00Z	Revenue	3935000000	3835000000	As such, we now expect full year revenue to be in the range of $3.835 billion to $3.935 billion. Our dealers reduced their inventories as expected in the first quarter of this year, and we estimate that dealer inventory reductions accounted for roughly $40 million or nearly half of our product revenue decline.

TRMB.OQ	2023-05-03T08:00:00Z	EBITDA			From a margin perspective, we indicated that EBITDA margins would be about 30%. I still think that's the long-term trend, but we've lost a little bit of fixed cost leverage. It's just growing a little more slowly than we'd expect. It's still growing. Probably the simplest way to think about that for the year, Jerry, is Transporeon margins will be pretty close to the Trimble average this year and then higher as the business gets back to growth or higher levels of growth.

GLW.N	2022-07-26T08:30:00Z	Revenue			As we take a look at retail, what we say is we'd expect TV units to probably be down this year now especially given what has happened with the China shutdowns. But it could be flat. I was wondering if you can update us around your assumption for TV units for '22 and maybe initial look into '23. On Display, as you would have heard in our opening, we are -- we expect our volume to be in line with where our panel makers are taking their utilization and down some 15% in quarter 3.

PEAK.N	2022-02-09T11:00:00Z	Revenue			92% exclude our newly announced Vantage project. And then maybe you could talk a little bit about how cap rates have also trended in your markets since rent growth has been so strong. And then second question is just on the life science rents that you talked about in the last year growing well over double digit, still a very low vacancy in those markets that you're in. And we expect our embedded $10-plus billion shadow development pipeline will be a key driver of our future growth. At the same time, when we look at the supply-demand fundamentals as well as our own portfolio, where we're essentially fully leased other than the normal frictional vacancy for downtime to build out TIs, we are expecting that the rent growth will be quite attractive in 2022. During the last 5 years, we delivered $1.4 billion of life science development at an average yield of 8%, which compares to stabilized cap rates for these Class A assets of 4% or less. For Class A space in the 3 core markets today are probably plus or minus 4%, depending upon the mark-to-market that exists at that building. Given the huge leasing demand and tight market conditions for high-quality life science products, we continue to see tenants commit to space before steel has even come out of the ground. I don't know that we would predict that that's going to continue in 2022. More recently, it's obviously been higher, double digits, approaching 20% in San Diego and Boston over the past year. On market rents, over the last decade in the 3 core markets, the compounded growth rate has been in the 7% range. Our active $1.6 billion life science and MOB pipeline is projected to provide a 7% weighted average yield on cost and a 74% pre-leased. So I guess I'm just wondering if you still think that the potential for rent growth over the next year is still over 10% for your markets? So certainly, pricing is strong. So if anything, that mark-to-market across our portfolio, looking forward probably grows rather than declines. So if anything, you'd expect a 100% purchase with full control to trade at even lower cap rates. So it's somewhere in that range, and there's been plenty of trades in that general range in the past quarter or 2, even for minority positions or noncontrolling interests. That's pretty high. With consideration to the scarcity and current pricing for well-located, stabilized life science and on-campus MOB properties, our development machine has become a growing part of our growth strategy in addition to accretive acquisitions.

FIS.N	2023-02-13T08:30:00Z	Revenue	14535000000	14285000000	The first of these headwinds has been a lack of new product investment, driving compression and attrition in our SMB subsegment, accounting for approximately 3 points of headwind in our Merchant guide. We're confident this is near term in nature and will be directly addressed with the successful spin of Worldpay as it transitions to a growth-oriented capital structure and investment philosophy.

FIS.N	2022-02-15T08:30:00Z	Revenue	6100000000	5900000000	Based on our large and growing backlog as well as our expanding pipeline of new opportunities, we expect Banking to continue to grow high single digits in the midterm. In 2022, Banking will grow 6% or more due to approximately 200 basis points in grow overs. In summary, while we continue to see impacts from the pandemic in the short term, Merchant TAM is expected to grow 8% to 10% through the midterm, as shown on Slide 24. This is primarily due to lapping pandemic-related stimulus and expected lower termination fees.	Transcript
FIS.N	2023-05-22T15:50:00Z	Revenue			I expect backlog to mitigate. In fact, that's why as I gave guidance for banking for 2023, we had a lowered expectation around guidance. It might go negative here on us over the next couple of quarters and then come back out as we reposition ourselves and really focus on the selling.	Transcript
FIS.N	2023-04-27T08:00:00Z	Revenue			For the second quarter, we are anticipating banking organic revenue growth of 0% to 2%, which incorporates a continued reduction in nonrecurring revenue, and we remain confident in meeting or exceeding our organic growth outlook for the year.	Transcript
FIS.N	2023-04-27T08:00:00Z	EBITDA			With that in mind, for the year, we now anticipate consolidated organic revenue growth of 0% to 1%, adjusted EBITDA margins of 41.5% to 42.2% and adjusted earnings per share of $5.76 to $6.06.	Transcript

DAL.N	2022-07-13T10:00:00Z	Revenue	54726000000	52445750000	And as we increase the mix of premium seats in our fleet, improve the display and sales channels and see progression in the recovery of business, premium will continue to grow. Premium continues to lead with load factors and yields higher than 2019. We expect more than 60% of revenue will come from premium products and non-ticket revenue sources by 2024. We're on track to receive over $5 billion in remuneration this year from American Express, and we remain confident in our 2024 target of $7 billion.	Transcript
DAL.N	2022-10-13T10:00:00Z	Revenue	6567120000	5244575000	As we get closer and closer to it, it looks like it's -- we may need to increase that as we get closer to '24. But I think 60%, as you pointed out, was our aspirational target. But obviously, your revenue guidance is pretty positive, but I do think it's a sequential decline in your yields. I think we're at 54% now, but the goal is to get to 60% by 2024. I think we're very, very confident in getting to 60% given that we've been less restored internationally, and internationally has actually a higher component of premium revenues and -- as well as the new fleets coming in and the continuation of growth at American Express and (inaudible). So I think the one that we're not confident with right now is cargo for 2024. That optimism is also reflected in GBTA's recent travel survey where 80% of respondents expect travel volumes to increase in 2023 compared to '22. We expect corporate sales recovery in the December quarter in the low to mid-80s at a system level. Yes.	Transcript

Or what should people expect at Plex? We haven't broken out the specific growth targets for that portion of Information Solutions & Connected Services, but we have said that, that's double digit as is the ARR growth and Plex business is practically all annual recurring revenue, and we see that as good double-digit growth this year.

Our fiscal '23 guidance projects total reported sales growth of 14.5%. This is consistent with our expectations of improving component availability and the subsequent reduction in customer lead times. We are increasing our reported sales guidance to approximately $8.9 billion in fiscal '23 or 14.5% growth at the midpoint. With our current orders outlook, we anticipate exiting the year with backlog levels of around $5 billion, positioning us well for fiscal year '24.	Transcript

And what's the margin of safety in your forecast? Maybe you can sort of talk about what are the drivers of your higher targets? So you raised your medium-term targets. They're chasing targets that are pretty considerably higher, about 150 basis points higher than what we set at the corporate level.	Transcript
ETN.N	2023-05-02T11:00:00Z	EBIT			As a reminder, this is a 70 basis point increase at the midpoint from our 2022 all-time record margin.

And so -- but I will fall short from providing the specifics about this one. As highlighted last quarter, we opened new CSS facilities in San Diego, California and Shiga, Japan in the first half of this fiscal year and expect them to be long-term growth drivers for the segment. But have you seen any -- or can you just walk us through your ability to absorb the impact by moving customer projects to elsewhere in the network from Brussels? Finally, our Clinical Supply Services segment posted high single-digit net revenue and EBITDA growth compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2021. However, we all need to appreciate the tough customers. I believe, from other contexts, we're to believe that maybe that's a 6- or 7-month time frame. I can confirm that we're only going to restart this facility where we are satisfied meeting with the highest standards of quality and compliance. I can only share that we have deployed a significant amount of resources, internal and external experts, in my comment to this. I guess kind of two aspects of this question as well, one being the time frame that you expect this facility to be impacted as you remediate the issues. If you could confirm that. In addition to our positive organic performance, we received a strong boost from the first quarterly contribution from Bettera, which added more than 20 percentage points of net revenue growth to the segment. In fact, we have public disclosures that have been made around relationships with several key customers that extend through the fiscal '23 time frame. In terms of what the revenue profile of COVID looks like after 2024, we haven't -- sorry, after 2023, we haven't talked about that specifically, but we did clarify on today's call, Dave, that it's expected to be a significantly lower contributor in the outer years of our long-term target, especially with regards to fiscal '26. It did require some engineering a high-filtration system, which are ongoing. It sounds like the financial impact from the shutdown is clearly fairly manageable. Just a follow up on Dave's line of questioning there, Tom. My follow-up question, maybe a good seque, Alessandro, you touched on the 483. Our second biggest segment, Softgel and Oral Technologies, is now up to 6% to 8% with improved margins following the acquisition of Bettera. So the size of Catalent's battleship, if you will, gives us just the ability to absorb these types of normal course challenges that come up from time to time when you operate in a highly regulated space. So to answer your question, we have been able to absorb this. So with the first part of the question, look, we, of course, plan, work very, very hard and strive not to have these situations, and we expect from us surely the highest level of excellence. Specifically, they have way more data point than just one 483. The Bettera acquisition was an important factor in leading us to raise this segment's long-term net revenue growth rate to 6% to 8% and improving its margin profile. The investment is ongoing there. They experience and observe the performance of Catalent and add values We have said that we do expect our COVID revenue to continue to contribute into our fiscal '23 year. We operate over 50 sites across the globe, manufacturing over 7,000 products across 1,000 different customers.

CTLT.N	2023-05-19T08:15:00Z	Revenue			This is a segment where we expected a strong growth as we started the year, modified our expectations to much more modest growth in November and February, and now tracking to flat organic revenue growth for the full year.	Transcript
CTLT.N	2023-05-19T08:15:00Z	Revenue			The revenue accounting treatment for complex products with long production cycles will continue to be recognized on a percentage of completion basis when contract terminology determines our work related to commercial activity. These issues drove our EBITDA reduction in our reduced revised guidance to be greater than our revenue reduction due to the following dynamics. When I look at the overall picture, and notwithstanding the fact that we entered into this fiscal year with more ambitious expectations for our top line growth.	Transcript
CTLT.N	2022-11-01T08:15:00Z	EBIT			And look, I think our margins are looking to be flat this current year in the new guidance in comparison to where they were in the prior year. Yes. No, good question, Dave. Your margin forecast for the new guidance is essentially the same as the old guidance.	Transcript
CTLT.N	2022-02-01T08:15:00Z	EBIT			The Bettera acquisition was an important factor in leading us to raise this segment's long-term net revenue growth rate to 6% to 8% and improving its margin profile. They're not material, full disclosure, at this point in time in the overall map of the company. We did want to just highlight the fact that we will see these -- some additional costs here as a result of the remediation efforts that will have an adverse impact in the margin profile of the business in the second half of the year, primarily in the third quarter.

Finally, our Clinical Supply Services segment posted high single-digit net revenue and EBITDA growth compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2021.	Transcript
CTLT.N	2023-05-19T08:15:00Z	EBITDA			We are now reducing our fiscal '23 net revenue guidance to a range from $4.25 billion to $4.35 billion, and we are reducing our adjusted EBITDA guidance to range from $725 million to $775 million.	Transcript
CTLT.N	2022-06-07T13:00:00Z	EBITDA			Our long-term target you see on this page now by fiscal '26 is greater than $7.5 billion of revenue for the consolidated company at EBITDA margins of approximately 30%.	Transcript

And then obviously, we're looking at retail wireless and the network co to finance some of that business. I think it is in next year, and we'll look to refinance that with hopefully an equity component. So that's the big picture answer.	Transcript

NRG.N	2022-12-06T08:00:00Z	EBITDA			For NRG, we are using the midpoint of the 2023 guidance recently released, while for Vivint, since they have not issued yet 2023 guidance, we are using its 2022 EBITDA as a baseline for the pro forma calculation and the consistent estimate of its equivalent free cash flow before growth, assuming the transaction closes on January 1, 2023. On Slide 21, you can find a summary of the pro forma combined 2023 key financial metrics and 2025 equivalent run rate for the combined businesses. We now expect to deliver $835 million of incremental EBITDA in 2025, a 60% increase from our baseline. We told you we were going to launch several test-and-learn initiatives to validate our assumptions and determine the right business model and go-to-market strategy. Well, this highly accretive transaction provides the certainty on how we're going to achieve these goals and win.	Transcript

But the good news for the 2023 outlook, we think that the growth rates will be in the 10% to 12% range for information services on a constant currency basis, and we hope to do better than that. Just thinking about 2023 and what -- as you think about infoservices and post trade, what are the kind of good growth rates or appropriate growth rate to think about for the next 12 months or beyond? Wanted to follow up on just the nontransactional revenue.	Transcript

LMT.N	2023-04-18T11:00:00Z	Revenue			However, we anticipate little to no revenue impact from any potential delivery delay, and therefore, no material adverse effect on our 2023 P&L.	Transcript
LMT.N	2022-10-18T11:00:00Z	EBIT			2023, we'll see a step down from where they are this year in 2022. The other thing I just have to also mention is that where we see the margin pressure next year, a lot of that is driven at MFC.	Transcript
LMT.N	2023-03-16T10:30:00Z	EBIT			And I think there was a little bit of confusion in terms of how to read that because you think that, that much margin pressure suggests potential for -- maybe there's a zero-margin program that's actually sizable enough to drive the whole segment margin down that much. And so the only thing that we have there is for the timing, we'll see that over the next 5 years, it's possible based on facts and circumstances that we may have to do a pull forward loss based on -- based on the situation. Is that -- was that kind of the right takeaway for people to have about that? It's actually negative margin for -- it's a program that's in development today. Maybe to stay on the topic of missiles and prior control. So we've got protection there. The development part of it was -- is cost plus.	Transcript

We expect the remaining $200-plus million of commencements in 2023 to be somewhat evenly weighted throughout the balance of the year.	Transcript
DLR.N	2023-03-06T08:00:00Z	EBIT			And curious if you could unpack where that incremental utilization is coming from. And that has to do with -- we've been chopping a lot of wood on our renewals. And we believe that will be an incremental step-up in the less than a megawatt category. One of the other points, I think you referenced this earlier when you're discussing the business, so one of the other points that you're, I think, guiding on this year is higher utilization in 2023. We've been selling out of places where we have less pricing power, even on the larger footprint side, and the pricing panel continues to move in our favor.	Transcript
DLR.N	2023-04-27T17:00:00Z	EBIT			We also made meaningful progress on the turn in our fundamentals during the quarter, providing strong support to the organic operating metrics supporting our full year guidance, including cash and GAAP re-leasing spreads over 3%, same-capital cash NOI growth of 3% to 4% and year-end portfolio occupancy between 85% and 86%.

PSX.N	2022-11-01T12:00:00Z	EBITDA			And certainly, the piece that we control, we know we'll be moving, and we'll provide details next week. But we'll be more focused on what we're doing to drive our mid-cycle going forward. What the -- has the market mid-cycle moved, it has our ability to generate EBITDA move.	Transcript
PSX.N	2023-03-02T12:00:00Z	EBITDA			And every dollar per barrel on gasoline is $320 million of EBITDA a year. Every dollar diesel is $280 million a year. Every dollar on Canadian heavy is $100 million a year. We do believe it will be higher, but that's the baseline that you can utilize.	Transcript

SNPS.OQ	2022-03-09T12:30:00Z	EBIT			And then maybe -- you mentioned margins. But Synopsys has this larger IP portfolio. Can you walk us through how the IP portfolio may or may not -- could that be -- like how does that come into play relative to other software companies that may not have that IP kind of mix? IP, the business that Jason is referring to, roughly 20%-ish of the overall revenues, growing in the mid-teens, very profitable. It's a little bit more resource intensive. It's more a very profitable business. It's not a royalty business like ARM, but it's still very profitable, right? Let me put it into context. Margins are right now around the 10% range and improving over time. Of that $4.8 billion of revenue, 10% is roughly the Software Integrity business. Right. So on the margin side, obviously, you're seeing top line strength, which enables you to drive leverage. That's our emerging growth business of 15% to 20% growth long term. This year, we're on track to do roughly $4.8 billion in revenues at the midpoint of guidance, about 32% operating margins and then EPS growth in the mid-teens.	Transcript
