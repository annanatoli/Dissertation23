LSEG.L,2017-06-12T14:00:00Z,EBITDA,,,"Across the group, we will also remain highly focused on maintaining a strong cost discipline. All of this means, today, that we will deliver increased operating leverage and an improvement in operating margin to a target EBITDA margin for the group of 55% by 2019. And on Slide 63, we've absolutely reaffirmed our financial targets as an organization, which will include the continued delivery at the double-digit revenue growth, which will include improving on our EBITDA as well to near 50% in full year 2019. And over and above that in total, as Mark was saying earlier, we expect to deliver anticipated synergies of $48 million over 3 years. And you can hopefully see from the team, the talent, the numbers and the momentum that we're increasingly confident that that's absolutely achievable in the time frames we've outlined. At the group level, we believe we can hold operating expenses to 4% increase per annum at a time when we will continue to invest and expand. Before I hand over to Mark Makepeace and his team, on Slide 14, I want to summarize London Stock Exchange Group's commitment to continue to drive growth and to enhance our margins. David will give you further details, but as you can see on that slide, we are targeting continued double-digit revenue growth at both FTSE Russell and LCH. In terms of margin, we'll increase EBITDA margin to close to that of FTSE Russell by the end of the first 3 years post completion. The Yield Book acquisition is expected to be accretive to earnings in year one through the delivery of operational efficiencies and revenue synergies. These are the savings that we can confirm at this stage, but we will continue to focus on further efficiencies. We can deliver this next phase of cost synergies of GBP 50 million per annum by 2019.

MCO,2022-10-25T12:30:00Z,Revenue,6218000000,6218000000,"But we think that the rate of declines have probably bottomed out here in the third or fourth quarter, and we'll start to see gradual improvement throughout the balance of next year. Even though we've got -- so we've got a tough comp in the first quarter of next year from an issuance perspective. So if you could just be a little more specific what you meant when you think fourth and third quarter is likely to be a trough for debt issuance, noting that we still have unfavorable mix in the fourth quarter, like when would you expect MIS revenue to start to improve? So what I really meant was that the year-over-year quarterly declines in revenue in MIS, we would expect a trough in the third, fourth quarter of this year.",Transcript
MCO,2022-02-10T11:30:00Z,Revenue,6777620000,6653260000,"And Alex, I'm happy to or anybody else on the call, I'm happy to build on that and what went into that outlook, but let me just pause there and see if we can get to your next question. And I think, again, we're taking a long-term view. And is that related to what you just talked about on the ratings side? And it's through these organic investments, along with projected growth in our recurring revenue base, that we expect total MA organic revenue to grow at the higher end of the low teens percentage range, for example, to at least $4 billion by year-end 2025. And just to note there, RMS would contribute roughly $7 million per quarter of that number. And so we are reaffirming in the outlook that we issued today the medium term mid-30s MA adjusted operating margin as subscription-based products provide more operating leverage and as recurring revenue comprises an increasing proportion of MA's total revenue over the medium term. For example, the outlook for the 2022 MIS adjusted operating margin is 62% and is within our medium-term guidance range. I guess you might be able to argue, well, isn't there more upside with inflation? In terms of labor costs, Mark touched on it. So the MIS, sorry, the MCO medium-term target, which really includes the combined MA and MIS medium-term revenue guidance of at least an average annual 10% revenue CAGR, we see a path to achieving that organically. So we've put out a range for MIS revenue growth. The difference between our new medium-term adjusted EPS target and the prior long-term EPS guidance is primarily driven by the expectation for incremental organic strategic investment and reduced capital leverage from share repurchases based on the assumption that Moody's share price continues to increase as well as lower discrete tax benefits on a percentage basis as adjusted net income itself grows. The other thing that we're looking at, growth in the maturity walls given all of the debt that's been issued over the last several years, and that provides some support or kind of what I think of as like ballast for our transaction-based revenues. We've just finished 2 years of enormous issuance and we're entering a tightening cycle.",Transcript

MCO,2022-10-25T12:30:00Z,Revenue,,,"But we think that the rate of declines have probably bottomed out here in the third or fourth quarter, and we'll start to see gradual improvement throughout the balance of next year. Even though we've got -- so we've got a tough comp in the first quarter of next year from an issuance perspective. So if you could just be a little more specific what you meant when you think fourth and third quarter is likely to be a trough for debt issuance, noting that we still have unfavorable mix in the fourth quarter, like when would you expect MIS revenue to start to improve? So what I really meant was that the year-over-year quarterly declines in revenue in MIS, we would expect a trough in the third, fourth quarter of this year.",Transcript

And I think, again, we're taking a long-term view. And is that related to what you just talked about on the ratings side? And it's through these organic investments, along with projected growth in our recurring revenue base, that we expect total MA organic revenue to grow at the higher end of the low teens percentage range, for example, to at least $4 billion by year-end 2025. And just to note there, RMS would contribute roughly $7 million per quarter of that number. And so we are reaffirming in the outlook that we issued today the medium term mid-30s MA adjusted operating margin as subscription-based products provide more operating leverage and as recurring revenue comprises an increasing proportion of MA's total revenue over the medium term. For example, the outlook for the 2022 MIS adjusted operating margin is 62% and is within our medium-term guidance range. I guess you might be able to argue, well, isn't there more upside with inflation? In terms of labor costs, Mark touched on it. So the MIS, sorry, the MCO medium-term target, which really includes the combined MA and MIS medium-term revenue guidance of at least an average annual 10% revenue CAGR, we see a path to achieving that organically. So we've put out a range for MIS revenue growth. The difference between our new medium-term adjusted EPS target and the prior long-term EPS guidance is primarily driven by the expectation for incremental organic strategic investment and reduced capital leverage from share repurchases based on the assumption that Moody's share price continues to increase as well as lower discrete tax benefits on a percentage basis as adjusted net income itself grows. The other thing that we're looking at, growth in the maturity walls given all of the debt that's been issued over the last several years, and that provides some support or kind of what I think of as like ballast for our transaction-based revenues.

And MA's 2021 margin would have been forecast -- would have expanded -- or forecast to expand by approximately 300 basis points this year, so off of the 2020 base if we excluded the impact of recent acquisitions. And so the target of mid-30s includes ongoing improvements from both the underlying businesses as well as expanding the RMS margin, inclusive of expected synergies to, I would say, a similar level of mid-30s over the coming year -- years. And that's evident by the nearly 500 basis points that we've expanded margin between 2017 and 2020. How does RMS impact that? How should we think about RMS' impact on Moody's Analytics margins? I think you have a long-term target of mid-30s margin range. So maybe before providing some of the components based on your question that would get us to that mid-30s percent range, I think it's important just to give that context that when we are discussing our medium-term target, we're looking forward by approximately 3 to 5 years.

MCO,,,,,So we want to give people comfort that the machine is still at work behind the scenes.,
MCO,,,,,"Although our reported MA adjusted operating margin is expected to be approximately flat this year, we have demonstrated our ability to improve margins over time. And MA's 2021 margin would have been forecast -- would have expanded -- or forecast to expand by approximately 300 basis points this year, so off of the 2020 base if we excluded the impact of recent acquisitions. And so the target of mid-30s includes ongoing improvements from both the underlying businesses as well as expanding the RMS margin, inclusive of expected synergies to, I would say, a similar level of mid-30s over the coming year -- years. And that's evident by the nearly 500 basis points that we've expanded margin between 2017 and 2020. How does RMS impact that? How should we think about RMS' impact on Moody's Analytics margins? I think you have a long-term target of mid-30s margin range. So maybe before providing some of the components based on your question that would get us to that mid-30s percent range, I think it's important just to give that context that when we are discussing our medium-term target, we're looking forward by approximately 3 to 5 years. So we've got really good sort of underlying margin expansion. We have maintained our 2021 MA adjusted operating margin guidance of approximately 29%.",

And then lastly, looking at the Structured Finance category, that's certainly been in decline now for several quarters and CLO volumes, in particular, have been soft because of declines in loan issuance. And what are the other structured categories that could potentially mitigate the weakness that we're seeing there? Another area to point out for potential optimism is CLO spread tightening continues for AAAs. But we have commented on BvD and RDC sales growth expectations, which you can see, I think, on Slide 49 or Slide 50 of our third quarter investor presentation. Can you provide an update on your longer-term growth outlook for RD&A following the acquisition of RDC? Can you talk about how a normalization of ratings revenue growth next year in 2021 could impact margin performance overall? Encouragingly, we have seen recent bank forecasts that do project a return of CLO volume for 2021. How long do you expect this trend to persist? If we switch gears and talk a bit about profitability and margins, Moody's guided to operating margins of 50% this year compared to 47% last year with benefits from very strong margin flow-through from the ratings business. In fact, Carlyle just printed data, I think, 100 or just over 105 basis points last week, which, to my knowledge, is the tightest spread we've seen since the start of the COVID-19. It is possible. It's probably too early to comment definitively on 2021 MIS revenue growth expectations at this point. Let's switch gears and talk a little bit about Moody's Analytics. So there are several factors we're evaluating. The acquisition of Regulatory DataCorp, or RDC, certainly complements your Bureau van Dijk business, BvD, and helps expand Moody's position in the very high growth, know-your-customer industry. The next slide shows the outlook we gave in February, that pro forma sales for BvD and RDC's compliance or financial crime products were approximately $150 million in 2019, and we're expecting that to double by 2023, which is nearly a 20% compound annual growth rate. There could be some normalization in issuance volumes next year, but conditions remain really very supportive for issuance with low rates and tight spreads. Tighter spreads coupled together with the end of revolving periods for some of the 2016 to 2018 vintage CLOs could spur refi volume into next year. We are already seeing some pipeline activity in this regard. We have not yet given revenue guidance for RD&A beyond 2020. We'll provide our outlook together with the fourth quarter earnings call in February when we have more information.",Press Release

So what are the factors that drive the Moody's growth, revenue growth versus the overall debt issuance growth? So you often write about large issuances by issuers on our frequent issuer pricing constructs, typically generate less revenue per dollar of issuance than the same aggregate issuance amount comprised of many smaller issuance from issuers on the infrequent issuer based pricing. Specifically, we're expecting leverage loans and structured finance to have strong issuance volume growth this year, high-yield bonds and financial institutions to be relatively flattish and investment grade to see some of the largest relative year-over-year declines.

And when you combine that with MA's current insurance and asset management business, we're going to have an insurance and asset management franchise that's forecast to produce almost $500 million of revenue this year. But for the full year of 2021, we're looking to generate roughly $21 million of revenue on a stand-alone basis and then another $5 million to $10 million from integration into those 2 businesses. But it's going to lead over time to an increase in that recurring revenue. In addition to RMS' sizable revenue base, we believe the acquisition provides a few exciting growth opportunities. In terms of more broadly how the business is expected to progress, customer preferences for SaaS-based solutions over installations, I think, will naturally lead to continued decline in our onetime revenue. We're not looking to bring forward guidance today, but it's worth me reiterating that we projected at that time for aggregate global rated issuance to grow in the low single-digit percent range for the year, with issuance really to be down in the mid-single digits percent range in the third quarter and then possibly up in the mid-single digits percent range in the fourth quarter.",Transcript

MCO,2021-02-12T07:00:00Z,EBIT,,,"Additionally, while there could be an overall moderation of volumes, there could be a favorable mix of issuance should high-yield bonds, which you spoke about, bank loans, Structured Finance show strength, which are traditionally areas of greater infrequent issuance. And then lastly, looking at the Structured Finance category, that's certainly been in decline now for several quarters and CLO volumes, in particular, have been soft because of declines in loan issuance. And what are the other structured categories that could potentially mitigate the weakness that we're seeing there? Another area to point out for potential optimism is CLO spread tightening continues for AAAs. But we have commented on BvD and RDC sales growth expectations, which you can see, I think, on Slide 49 or Slide 50 of our third quarter investor presentation. Can you provide an update on your longer-term growth outlook for RD&A following the acquisition of RDC? Can you talk about how a normalization of ratings revenue growth next year in 2021 could impact margin performance overall? Encouragingly, we have seen recent bank forecasts that do project a return of CLO volume for 2021. How long do you expect this trend to persist? If we switch gears and talk a bit about profitability and margins, Moody's guided to operating margins of 50% this year compared to 47% last year with benefits from very strong margin flow-through from the ratings business. In fact, Carlyle just printed data, I think, 100 or just over 105 basis points last week, which, to my knowledge, is the tightest spread we've seen since the start of the COVID-19. It is possible. It's probably too early to comment definitively on 2021 MIS revenue growth expectations at this point. Let's switch gears and talk a little bit about Moody's Analytics. So there are several factors we're evaluating. The acquisition of Regulatory DataCorp, or RDC, certainly complements your Bureau van Dijk business, BvD, and helps expand Moody's position in the very high growth, know-your-customer industry. The next slide shows the outlook we gave in February, that pro forma sales for BvD and RDC's compliance or financial crime products were approximately $150 million in 2019, and we're expecting that to double by 2023, which is nearly a 20% compound annual growth rate. There could be some normalization in issuance volumes next year, but conditions remain really very supportive for issuance with low rates and tight spreads. Tighter spreads coupled together with the end of revolving periods for some of the 2016 to 2018 vintage CLOs could spur refi volume into next year. We are already seeing some pipeline activity in this regard. We have not yet given revenue guidance for RD&A beyond 2020. We'll provide our outlook together with the fourth quarter earnings call in February when we have more information.",Press Release

But a few areas we are especially optimistic around would be our KYC and Compliance Solutions in RD&A and also our ERS units. But which businesses within Moody's Analytics are you most optimistic about driving revenue growth within the segment over the next 2 to 3 years? Let me give you a little bit of color maybe on both of those. On the compliance and KYC side, so I'm going to go to Slide 43 here. So if I look at Slide 35, you can see here that Moody's Analytics has a strong track record of consistent revenue growth. So thank you for letting me spend a little bit of time on this one.

MCO,,,,,"And a quick reminder, the lead senior analyst tenure is on average of 15 years at Moody's. And of course, there's that offset from the sale of Max, which was a lower-margin business for the company. And then maybe just to round out the ratings discussion. And we estimated that was probably 50 basis points favorable to our 2020 adjusted operating margin. And we'll partially fund this by the $30 million in expense efficiencies we had initially talked about during our February earnings call. And we're not assuming any material headcount reductions in our current plan, which really means that the company will remain well positioned for growth post COVID-19. And we've also factored into our margin guidance prior M&A activity. But just curious on how you can continue to drive efficiencies. I think we have said there's really no ceiling to those margins. I thought it also would be a good point, sort of just to emphasize, that we will continue to invest in key growth initiatives like ESG, China and technology enablement. In addition, on the April earnings call, I mentioned several other cost reductions to offset our lower top line guidance, such as decreased variable compensation, decreased T&E, given some of the social distancing restrictions and project reprioritization. Just a quick reminder, the acquisitions we made last year, such as VE, Four Twenty Seven, ABS Suite, as well as with RDC this year, will be margin dilutive by approximately 70 basis points as we invest in them to build scale. Kind of a similar question, could you just help bridge the margin guidance from the 47.4% in '19 to your 2020 guidance of 46% to 48%? Our 2020 adjusted margin guidance is in the range of, that we gave back in April, 55% to 57%. So on Slide 59, you can see here that MIS has a strong margin growth in the first quarter, around 550 basis points, and that was driven primarily by strong revenue as well as productivity improvements and changes in the organizational structure. Sure. The margins are obviously very impressive, touching 60%-plus in a couple of investor days ago. We also want to make sure that we continue to invest in experienced analysts, which we consistently hear from issuers and investors has been critical to them. We will continue our efforts on the continuation of productivity improvements across some of the support functions and real estate, technology and digital infrastructure, I'd say, as well as in-sourcing from the technology centers in order to drive further margin growth. We've taken a number of cost actions, including the 2018, 2019 restructuring program, which resulted in $60 million of run rate savings. Well, we're pleased to be able to guide to a similar level of 2020 adjusted operating margin performance for the company as compared to 2019 despite our revenue guidance revision, from mid-single-digit growth to a mid-single-digit decline. What are the different initiatives in place that keep the margins pushing higher, basically?",
MCO,,,,,"December 31, 2020",
MCO,,,,,"And maybe the most important one is that the ERS business, which is $500 million-ish in revenue, we're thinking and working with the tools that the ERS team has created very much as a platform or a chassis to help with cross-selling. I think we have some very positive trends that I think are maybe secular and I think will contribute to margin expansion over time. Or are there some unique elements to 2020 that are maybe driving above trend scalability? So the increase from 2019 to 2020, a couple of hundred basis points, would you think that sort of pace of increase is sustainable? Yes. 200 basis points every year forever might be a little tricky.",

That business is actually coming off really strong top line growth and, quite frankly, margin expansion over the last couple of years.

But just the recurring line item that you guys report on the ratings side, there's obviously the constant rating of all outstanding bonds in there. But we don't necessarily think there will be a material impact to that recurring revenue line. But what else is in that line item? But where was that incremental pressure that caused that slight reduction? For example, increasing virtual sales meetings and adapting to customer purchasing behavior by launching new product features and otherwise addressing what I think of as pertinent customer needs. However, the delays of CECL, Basel III, IFRS 17 has put a little bit of additional pressure on the underlying ERS growth rate. I'd say that we expect lower growth in both the RD&A and the ERS lines of business. In terms of the 2020 outlook, Rob also mentioned on the April earnings call that if we see a meaningful increase in defaults, we could have some attrition from rated issuers. In your updated guidance, I think it was low double digits before, now it's high single digits, which is still an impressive number, especially in this environment. Maybe just shifting to the analytics business real quick. So organic growth is a good place for me to start. The increase also includes revenue contribution from the Vigeo Eiris and Four Twenty Seven acquisitions. We are actively mitigating factors impacting our sales activities. We expect revenue growth to be impacted by COVID-19 with regard to our ability to close on sales from the existing pipeline as well as the ability to generate new sales opportunities in the upcoming quarters. With approximately 6-ish weeks of experience under these conditions, we've updated our sales outlook to incorporate the impacts of COVID-19 on our sales generation for the remainder of 2020. You can see that recurring revenue was 35% of total revenue in the first quarter 2020, which is down 39% in the prior year, given the strength of supply that we saw in the first quarter in 2020.

MCO,2020-10-29T11:30:00Z,EBIT,,,"And a quick reminder, the lead senior analyst tenure is on average of 15 years at Moody's. And of course, there's that offset from the sale of Max, which was a lower-margin business for the company. And then maybe just to round out the ratings discussion. And we estimated that was probably 50 basis points favorable to our 2020 adjusted operating margin. And we'll partially fund this by the $30 million in expense efficiencies we had initially talked about during our February earnings call. And we're not assuming any material headcount reductions in our current plan, which really means that the company will remain well positioned for growth post COVID-19. And we've also factored into our margin guidance prior M&A activity. But just curious on how you can continue to drive efficiencies. I think we have said there's really no ceiling to those margins. I thought it also would be a good point, sort of just to emphasize, that we will continue to invest in key growth initiatives like ESG, China and technology enablement. In addition, on the April earnings call, I mentioned several other cost reductions to offset our lower top line guidance, such as decreased variable compensation, decreased T&E, given some of the social distancing restrictions and project reprioritization. Just a quick reminder, the acquisitions we made last year, such as VE, Four Twenty Seven, ABS Suite, as well as with RDC this year, will be margin dilutive by approximately 70 basis points as we invest in them to build scale. Kind of a similar question, could you just help bridge the margin guidance from the 47.4% in '19 to your 2020 guidance of 46% to 48%? Our 2020 adjusted margin guidance is in the range of, that we gave back in April, 55% to 57%. So on Slide 59, you can see here that MIS has a strong margin growth in the first quarter, around 550 basis points, and that was driven primarily by strong revenue as well as productivity improvements and changes in the organizational structure. Sure. The margins are obviously very impressive, touching 60%-plus in a couple of investor days ago. We also want to make sure that we continue to invest in experienced analysts, which we consistently hear from issuers and investors has been critical to them. We will continue our efforts on the continuation of productivity improvements across some of the support functions and real estate, technology and digital infrastructure, I'd say, as well as in-sourcing from the technology centers in order to drive further margin growth. We've taken a number of cost actions, including the 2018, 2019 restructuring program, which resulted in $60 million of run rate savings. Well, we're pleased to be able to guide to a similar level of 2020 adjusted operating margin performance for the company as compared to 2019 despite our revenue guidance revision, from mid-single-digit growth to a mid-single-digit decline.

Most forecasts, for example, for storage talked about getting to $200 -- $300 a kilowatt hour by 2020 as recently as 2 or 3 years ago. So I think that trend is also similar to wind and solar, where prices fell faster than expected. So I want to emphasize not only are these costs declining both storage and offshore wind, they're declining faster than expected. The top left is for battery storage; and the bottom right is for offshore wind.",Press Release

MCO,2018-02-28T08:30:00Z,EBIT,,,"And so how fast is that growing for you to raise that long-term guidance on the top line from mid-to high single digits. And with that, I'll turn it over to Mark, whom I hope got some sleep on the plane on the way over. Business generates a lot of cash flow. I'll let Mark take the first part of that when he is finished being mic'd up, which is happening right now. Is only about 9% or 8% of your pro forma business. It is subscription business with 90%-plus recurring revenues and very high renewal rates. Now what's perhaps most important is the impact of the acquisition of the business on our top and our bottom line. Obviously, GDP growth has been more stagnant around the world than we had thought and we are -- we thought that was a headwind that we might have some trouble dealing with. Okay. Similarly, we expect that now we're at low teens in EPS growth which moves up from high single-digit to low double-digit. So after a bit of dilution in '17 and that's just very modest, we expect to be accretive to GAAP EPS in 2019, and adjusted EPS in 2018. So if you start in the period of 2016 and you're adding the synergies, you look out a couple of years, we expect about 3 percentage points addition to the revenue run rate at the Corporation. So maybe just a little bit of history on why you lowered it in February, and then the follow-up question is, BVD we'll call it BVD for short for now. So the first question after the acquisition yesterday, you guys raised your long-term guidance back up after having lowered it in February. So we expect $45 million in annual revenue and expense synergies by 2019, increasing to $80 million by 2021. So we expect now that revenue growth will move from high single digit -- will now be high single digit moving up from mid-single digit to high single digit, which we had said previously. That growth rate includes, as I said, synergies that we're expecting from the business and we began -- that measurement starts in 2016 as we had said. We expect it to have a positive impact on earnings. We expect that the acquisition will deliver significant synergies. We have previously reduced guidance for the company because we're concerned about long-term growth. We think Bureau van Dijk acquisition is very nice offset to that, again, very high recurring revenues in subscription business and one which is much more predictable.",Transcript
MCO,2018-02-09T11:30:00Z,EBIT,,,"And for Europe, the numbers are a little bit more modest: flat for investment-grade issuance, speculative-grade bonds growing at 13% CAGR, and bank loans at an 8% CAGR. And we expect revenue to be -- growth in the high single digits now and EPS growth in the low teens because Bureau van Dijk is a large-enough business to move the needle for the corporation. And we have our pricing initiatives, which remain an important part of the Moody's story. As we've mentioned before, we look for pricing in line with creating value for investors, and we've noted for the corporation as a whole, over time, 3% to 4% pricing ability. But again, particularly in North America, the growth in debt that needs to be refinanced or rolled over is quite strong in the coming years. Moody's Analytics business is one which we have very good control over the growth of that business. Now a very important part of Moody's baseline revenue is refinancing of debt that's already in the marketplace. Now as we move forward into the long-term growth view of the corporation, we've got -- the 3 main levers of the business include revenue, operating margin and capital allocation, which together form our earnings per share growth. Now in order to do that, we have to get some synergies, the third bullet point, $45 million in revenue and expense synergies by 2019. On the upper left, you can see revenue growth, CAGR for the company at 7%. So if you look at North America on the top set of bars and Europe, Mideast and Africa in the bottom set of bars, you can see the CAGR on investment-grade debt, which is the green bars, growing at 4%. So our revenue growth, we're looking for mid- to high single-digit growth over the next several years. So this is a business which becomes accretive to us quite quickly. This is debt we already rate. We want that to grow to $80 million by 2021. We would expect to see it again.",Transcript

There's some, but not a lot of seasonality there to answer the specific question you were asking.",Press Release

And it's something similar for offshore wind with the -- when the $100 price was expected to be reached in 2020, well, it's already been reached in 2016, 3 or 4 years ahead of schedule. And the expectations are that they're going to be around $100 by the 2020, 2021 time frame. And we recently saw a solar [plus] storage project sponsored by NextEra Energy, which is the -- one of the largest utilities in the country, come in at $0.05 a kilowatt hour for solar and storage combined, which was really -- which really attracted a lot of attention within the industry. But if you look at storage, which is definitely applicable to the U.S., you see how storage prices have gone from somewhere between $900 to $1,000 per kilowatt hour down to about $200 today. I mean, they -- you're seeing the same trends here. In this case, not in the U.S., but in Europe. Most forecasts, for example, for storage talked about getting to $200 -- $300 a kilowatt hour by 2020 as recently as 2 or 3 years ago. So I think that trend is also similar to wind and solar, where prices fell faster than expected. So I want to emphasize not only are these costs declining both storage and offshore wind, they're declining faster than expected. The top left is for battery storage; and the bottom right is for offshore wind.",Press Release

MCO,2018-02-28T08:30:00Z,EBIT,,,"And so how fast is that growing for you to raise that long-term guidance on the top line from mid-to high single digits. And with that, I'll turn it over to Mark, whom I hope got some sleep on the plane on the way over. Business generates a lot of cash flow. I'll let Mark take the first part of that when he is finished being mic'd up, which is happening right now. Is only about 9% or 8% of your pro forma business. It is subscription business with 90%-plus recurring revenues and very high renewal rates. Now what's perhaps most important is the impact of the acquisition of the business on our top and our bottom line. Obviously, GDP growth has been more stagnant around the world than we had thought and we are -- we thought that was a headwind that we might have some trouble dealing with. Okay. Similarly, we expect that now we're at low teens in EPS growth which moves up from high single-digit to low double-digit. So after a bit of dilution in '17 and that's just very modest, we expect to be accretive to GAAP EPS in 2019, and adjusted EPS in 2018. So if you start in the period of 2016 and you're adding the synergies, you look out a couple of years, we expect about 3 percentage points addition to the revenue run rate at the Corporation. So maybe just a little bit of history on why you lowered it in February, and then the follow-up question is, BVD we'll call it BVD for short for now. So the first question after the acquisition yesterday, you guys raised your long-term guidance back up after having lowered it in February. So we expect $45 million in annual revenue and expense synergies by 2019, increasing to $80 million by 2021. So we expect now that revenue growth will move from high single digit -- will now be high single digit moving up from mid-single digit to high single digit, which we had said previously. That growth rate includes, as I said, synergies that we're expecting from the business and we began -- that measurement starts in 2016 as we had said. We expect it to have a positive impact on earnings. We expect that the acquisition will deliver significant synergies. We have previously reduced guidance for the company because we're concerned about long-term growth. We think Bureau van Dijk acquisition is very nice offset to that, again, very high recurring revenues in subscription business and one which is much more predictable.",Transcript
MCO,2018-02-09T11:30:00Z,EBIT,,,"And for Europe, the numbers are a little bit more modest: flat for investment-grade issuance, speculative-grade bonds growing at 13% CAGR, and bank loans at an 8% CAGR. And we expect revenue to be -- growth in the high single digits now and EPS growth in the low teens because Bureau van Dijk is a large-enough business to move the needle for the corporation. And we have our pricing initiatives, which remain an important part of the Moody's story. As we've mentioned before, we look for pricing in line with creating value for investors, and we've noted for the corporation as a whole, over time, 3% to 4% pricing ability. But again, particularly in North America, the growth in debt that needs to be refinanced or rolled over is quite strong in the coming years. Moody's Analytics business is one which we have very good control over the growth of that business. Now a very important part of Moody's baseline revenue is refinancing of debt that's already in the marketplace. Now as we move forward into the long-term growth view of the corporation, we've got -- the 3 main levers of the business include revenue, operating margin and capital allocation, which together form our earnings per share growth. Now in order to do that, we have to get some synergies, the third bullet point, $45 million in revenue and expense synergies by 2019. On the upper left, you can see revenue growth, CAGR for the company at 7%. So if you look at North America on the top set of bars and Europe, Mideast and Africa in the bottom set of bars, you can see the CAGR on investment-grade debt, which is the green bars, growing at 4%. So our revenue growth, we're looking for mid- to high single-digit growth over the next several years. So this is a business which becomes accretive to us quite quickly. This is debt we already rate. We want that to grow to $80 million by 2021. We would expect to see it again.",Transcript

As we've talked about, it is a combination of both revenue and cost synergies. By 2021, that $80 million synergy target should be roughly split equally between revenue and expense? Can you just give us a rough breakdown between costs versus revenue? Good day, and welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to the Moody's Acquisition of Bureau van Dijk Conference Call. On top of BvD's very attractive stand-alone financial performance, we expect to realize approximately $45 million in annual revenue and expense synergies by 2019, with those synergies growing to approximately $80 million by 2021. So I just have a quick question on revenue and cost synergies of the $80 million.",Press Release

But if there could be some sort of abatement of the hostilities in Ukraine, you could see the price of oil is coming back down. But net-net, it's down. But right now, kind of a range bound $90 million to $110 million. It's been declining for many years because of the -- where it had arrived in terms of its negative growth, plus the opportunities for repurposing a lot of their analytics for new types of opportunities for underground as an example, wind farms, which are offshore, need to do a lot of the same kind of geological mapping that an oilfield offshore will do. Oil prices are much higher than they normally would be, which means that all energy prices are a lot higher. So that's actually one of the positives of the merger that we can repurpose a lot of the software, the analytics in the upstream business. So the upstream business, which had been a drag, has now actually flattened out, and we're going to be expecting growth from it. There are still -- the only couple of bright spots, covered bonds in Europe, which were not -- it's not a big area for us. We expect that the full year will be down 30% to 45%.

And you could say pass, you could say pass. In general terms, I think the formula we always think about is there is issuance growth, and particularly, in investment grade, it's linked to GDP growth. Like do you think that -- thinking about next year, that the Ratings revenues business will outperform the issuance environment? So definitely, if you would think about those elements, there is more than only the issuance forecast or GDP that goes into the mix that ultimately drives the outlook. So that is usually the formula of how we think about it. Then there is pricing. We can't talk about forward-looking pricing, but you know we have always done something like 3% to 4%.

And then there is also continued work around making the Ratings organization more effective, taking complexity out, taking layers of the organization out and making it more an effective organization. And we have in fact seen that in periods where the debt issuance market was a bit weaker at the end of last year, the beginning of this year, our margins were still developing in a favorable way, and now we can continue on that also when the issuance markets look more favorable. But you should expect basically the same trends, the same activities, the same management actions to continue in the future. Continued revenue growth, which is a combination of new issuance, refinancings, of course commercial contract changes, new initiatives that we put in place in Ratings, think about the ESG Evaluations, think about our launch of Ratings activities in other countries around the world. Could you talk a little bit more about the strong Ratings margin expansion in the quarter? Obviously, we are also very pleased with the progress we are making. Or did you take more price than normal? Overall, Ratings margins on a trailing 4 quarter basis were at the level of 56.7%. So according to our standards, we are not really at the level of our aspirational margin targets of high 50s, so I have a bit of room still there to grow. So overall, expenses going up 4% this quarter, and the top line going up 13% I think is clearly a very good combination, and that is helping margins.

And just I guess just some additional color on what drove the margins down in the quarter would be helpful. And the reason is that we are also seeing, at the same time, the benefits of our productivity plans. Do you need sort of like a mid-single-digit growth to get that leverage there? If you look at the margin development in the first quarter of Ratings, we are overall satisfied with the results we are seeing. My first question is on Ratings' margins. So I just wanted to ask, at what level do you start getting operating leverage in the Ratings segment? So overall, we still expect Ratings margins to expand year-over-year 2019 compared to 2018.

So clearly, comps get easier during the second half of the year. So overall, if the expectation is somewhere around flattish issuance year-over-year, I think that's a good expectation.

During 2018, we achieved the target in 3 of our 4 businesses. During 2018, we delivered 23%. During Investor Day in May 2018, we introduced medium-term aspirational targets for the company. In 2018, we returned 108% through share repurchases and dividends. In addition, we expect capital expenditures of approximately $120 million and free cash flow, excluding certain items, in the range of $2.2 billion to $2.3 billion. Now lastly, I would like to introduce our 2019 guidance. Please keep in mind that our guidance reflects current spot market ForEx rates. Therefore, we are providing guidance on corporate unallocated expense excluding any revenue of $155 million to $165 million; deal-related amortization of $120 million to $125 million; Kensho retention plans of $20 million to $25 million; operating profit margin in the range of 48.8% to 49.8%; interest expense of $145 million to $150 million; a tax rate of 22.5% to 23.5%, this is an increase over 2018 because we expect to have a lower benefit from employee stock-based compensation as well as less discrete benefits from prior year tax adjustments; and diluted EPS, which excludes deal-related amortization, of $8.95 to $9.15. This slide depicts our GAAP guidance. This slide shows our adjusted guidance, an increase in revenue of mid-single-digits with contributions by every business segment. Unfortunately, Ratings fell short due to market factors. We are pleased to use this morning's investor call to reiterate these targets and to share the great progress we have made in just the first year. We have decided to record Kensho revenue in Market Intelligence going forward. We target low double-digit adjusted EPS growth. We target to deliver organic revenue growth of mid to high single-digit each year. We're committed to return at least 75% of our free cash flow each year.",Transcript

Our research group has modified it a little bit, and it's now closer to 0, maybe a small up, but it depends on which kind of subcategory. So clearly, comps get easier during the second half of the year. So overall, if the expectation is somewhere around flattish issuance year-over-year, I think that's a good expectation.

And just I guess just some additional color on what drove the margins down in the quarter would be helpful. And the reason is that we are also seeing, at the same time, the benefits of our productivity plans. Do you need sort of like a mid-single-digit growth to get that leverage there? If you look at the margin development in the first quarter of Ratings, we are overall satisfied with the results we are seeing. My first question is on Ratings' margins. So I just wanted to ask, at what level do you start getting operating leverage in the Ratings segment? So overall, we still expect Ratings margins to expand year-over-year 2019 compared to 2018. Understandably, the weakness in issuance led to the lower Ratings growth in the quarter, but I think margins were just a little bit lighter than what we were expecting.

And then just overall on pricing, I remember 5 to 7 years ago, when we first started covering the rating agencies, we were talking about the average price of an issuance at 5 basis points. But otherwise, corporate and financial institutions revenue was up each and every year over the last 16 years. But what we could say is historically every year, a normal price increase would be a couple of percent points. It's growing year-by-year over the last 16 years with the exception of 2008, when the drop of corporate and financial institutions revenue was 7%. So I think if you look at what do we expect for Ratings revenues -- and by the way, this is pretty stable over a longer period of time. So how we look at it is future growth will be GDP growth plus a few percent price increase plus then all of the initiatives that we're taking. So in a stressed scenario of 2008, it was only 7% down. So those are all the additional opportunities for future revenue growth in Ratings as well. Today, it's 6.25. We are looking at international growth. We look at green bonds.

Jeff, this is Ewout. Therefore, we always expected that margins of Market Intelligence would improve during the next few quarters.

And then just overall on pricing, I remember 5 to 7 years ago, when we first started covering the rating agencies, we were talking about the average price of an issuance at 5 basis points. But otherwise, corporate and financial institutions revenue was up each and every year over the last 16 years. But what we could say is historically every year, a normal price increase would be a couple of percent points. It's growing year-by-year over the last 16 years with the exception of 2008, when the drop of corporate and financial institutions revenue was 7%. So I think if you look at what do we expect for Ratings revenues -- and by the way, this is pretty stable over a longer period of time. So how we look at it is future growth will be GDP growth plus a few percent price increase plus then all of the initiatives that we're taking. So in a stressed scenario of 2008, it was only 7% down. So those are all the additional opportunities for future revenue growth in Ratings as well. Today, it's 6.25. We are looking at international growth. We look at green bonds.

And if you go back and look at our initial guidance in each of those 6 years, we guided somewhere between 100, 150 basis points of margin improvement each year. And we've been fortunate to be able to achieve more than that each year. But I believe both will continue. But that has been -- sorry, guidance this year is consistent with guidance in previous years. I can't truly split out the differences for you, so I apologize for that. I mean, there is a piece that's based on revenue growth. I think we'll continue to have revenue growth and I think we'll continue to make great strides in productivity. Now maybe on the margin guidance, you folks are guiding to about 48% margins at the midpoint, about 100 basis points above 2017, which is much a stronger margin expansion. So I've been with the company now 6 years. That's the best I can do on the answer. There's a piece based on productivity. Yes. Your question on the other part is kind of unanswerable.",Transcript

MSCI.K,2019-01-31T11:00:00Z,Revenue,,,"Although we saw a modest increase in average basis point fees as a result of strong flows into international exposure and factor funds, coupled by market declines in U.S. exposure products, we continue to expect lower fee products to capture a disproportionate share of new flows into equity ETFs. Our disciplined approach to funding growth and managing capital have paid off, and we expect to continue to invest in high-return projects to drive top line growth in 2019 and beyond. Our guidance is a reflection of our balanced and disciplined approach to margin expansion and funding for growth. This approach has paid off as we've seen with higher subscription growth rates and substantial margin expansion over the last few years. We expect a further decline in our average basis point fee levels as part of our efforts to capture volume and achieve continued run rate growth. We expect to continue to fund high-return projects to accelerate top line growth.

Our disciplined approach to funding growth and managing capital have paid off, and we expect to continue to invest in high-return projects to drive top line growth in 2019 and beyond. Our guidance is a reflection of our balanced and disciplined approach to margin expansion and funding for growth. This approach has paid off as we've seen with higher subscription growth rates and substantial margin expansion over the last few years.

So that is something that we are anticipating. The other that I think all companies are experiencing right now are the heightened level of inflation and impact on compensation expectations over time.",Transcript

As we look to 2022, we expect to deploy the after-tax proceeds from the sale of our 3E and Verisk Financial businesses for share repurchases in addition to our normal pace of quarterly repurchases, which we generally execute through an accelerated share repurchase program. Given that the transaction is likely to close in the first quarter of 2022, financial results for this business will be included in our GAAP results but will be excluded from all organic constant currency growth figures.

As we spoke about during Investor Day, we are seeing the benefit of our strategic investments and we feel we have a long runway ahead of us. CUSIP may bring it down a couple of basis points, but we're only going to be including that in the back half of the year, as you noted. So I think if you look at the midpoint of our guidance, which is $165 million, and you divide that into the $1.84 billion that we ended the year at, that gets you closer to 9%. So I was wondering if you could just provide some more color on the confidence around the ASV growth for '23. So as that becomes organic, it's going to weigh on the growth. So that's 400 basis points of acceleration in analytics. So the midpoint of our guidance is around 9%.

CUSIP may bring it down a couple of basis points, but we're only going to be including that in the back half of the year, as you noted. So I think if you look at the midpoint of our guidance, which is $165 million, and you divide that into the $1.84 billion that we ended the year at, that gets you closer to 9%. So I was wondering if you could just provide some more color on the confidence around the ASV growth for '23. So as that becomes organic, it's going to weigh on the growth.

FDS,2020-09-24T11:00:00Z,Revenue,,,"And Phil, over the years, FactSet has always, I think, prioritized growth, which I agree and it's important. And what's driving that opportunity recently? But -- and just before, obviously, you transfer your CFO duties, maybe just some perspective on -- since you came in, I mean, clearly, you've done a lot for FactSet already, just -- maybe just a recap for the audience what you've done, or maybe asked another way, like where have you left the finance organization? But as we exit now into -- as we are in '21, I think what we find ourselves is much better from a transparency into our own businesses. But right now, we are committed to making sure we're investing as much as we can in both technology and content to get back to a higher top line growth rate. But there are more workflows in the wealth space that we're beginning to look at to say, okay, like if we want to capture more of the adviser wealth workflow like we do for institutional asset management, what would that mean? But you've also kind of managed the margins in that low 30s levels, if you call it. Can you just talk about -- I know you haven't sized the TAM before, but maybe just a perspective on whether it's how -- which inning you are in the picture you feel? Clearly, you've had some marquee announcements there. I do think, over time, even though it's not probably short or medium term, there is an opportunity for us on the margin side. I think of research as your institutional investors and then wealth is their own category. Just a little bit more on your philosophy on that kind of balance or trade-off the way you look at it. Like what is the -- what is your success going to be really in charge of doing for the next few years? So I think 18 months ago, we committed to investing more in our business historically than we have from a margin standpoint. So first, just on the wealth business, right? So that particular market, we estimate is probably around $2 billion, and we have a small piece of that and are very optimistic that we can take market share there. So we're optimistic that, that's going to drive top line growth and that will allow us to continue to invest in the business. The rigor and discipline around how we look at investments and the fact that what we've got left now is getting even more so into defining from an M&A perspective or from organic, how do we better track all of the returns that we're getting. We'll be asking you a lot more questions there then. You seem to be growing 9%, I think it was last year.",Transcript

FDS,2021-03-30T06:59:00Z,Revenue,,,"And perhaps discuss if there are any offsetting factors to the upside that might mitigate that impact? And that is based not only on top line but also on margins. But what I wanted to give was, what is that impact for the entire year? First of all, Helen, can you just -- you made the comment at the end there about the fourth quarter, I think, 60 to 75 basis points. Given its timing and nature, an increase in ASV in the fourth quarter will not materially change revenue in fiscal year '21, but would result in a higher bonus accrual. I wanted to follow-up on the margin question earlier and the impact of higher bonus accruals. I would also add what we're seeing come through that likely on the tax rate side, we'll be on the lower end as well. Or how would you characterize that 60 to 75? Right. So I think that, that is a fair way of thinking about it. So in this particular quarter, because once we had greater visibility, Alex, into where we would see -- we anticipate for the year, then we had to both true-up for the first half as well as increase for Q3. So the 60 to 75 would have been beyond what we would have provided in terms of our original plan. So the way I think about it is really 60 to 75 for the year. So we should take both of those into a bit of consideration. So yes, the impact for the year is higher. The 60 to 75 bps of margin impact full year, can you clarify if that's relative to your original margin expectations for fiscal 2021 which would imply you would land in the bottom half of your guidance range? The related expense would impact our margins by an incremental 60 to 75 basis points. Was that relative to what we just saw in the third quarter? We believe that we will remain within our stated annual guidance ranges. We do think from a margin perspective, though, overall, we'll be on the lower end of our range. We would say it's somewhere between, we think, 60 to 75 basis points depending on where we end up.",Press Release

And in fact, we delivered earnings per share growth every single year since we've been a public company and on average, 18% a year. And the way we've been able to do that is we invest today for the next 2 or 3 things that will drive the growth in the future. And what's your time line like right now for the ETF Hub kind of going live, and your expectations for when it starts to see some real volume? But given the number of partners who've reached out to us and talked to us about what we're building and wanted to partner with us in building it, I'm excited about it. But it's really -- I think, the hub is a driver for us in 2020, 2021 and in the future. I think from an actual contribution and volume standpoint, it's really more of a 2020 story. The hub is one, the mortgage investments are another that I think are exciting. Yes, so our expectation right now is that the Hub will go live later this year.",Transcript

ICE,2019-12-11T10:00:00Z,Revenue,,,"And for us, that when you put that quadrant, that mix together, it's a mid-single-digit, pretty recurring, pretty steady growth that is done under contract, longer term contracts. And it may be because of the strategy that you just rearticulated that we laid out was that we were going to constantly add new content, new things, new analytics, new inputs into our offering. And that's really, I think, the difference. And we still think that, that's there. And what we've seen is that the unit price per piece of data is probably coming down. At the Investor Day a few years back, you guys talked about data services growth as a whole, kind of growing in the mid- to high single-digit range. But as long as you're continuing to grow your outputs, the wallet is actually going up because there's kind of a thirst for more and unique information as people are moving to more automation, more analytics and to a certain degree, more regulatory oversight that keeps that wallet going up. But honestly, what we see is not -- we don't see that. Help us understand kind of what's been some of the headwinds in that business for you guys recently that's keeping growth from being closer to the upper bound of that guide and really just kind of the outlook for the next couple of years? If you look at the more recent trend, and I think the guidance to the next year, you guys talked about kind of like the 4% to 6% sort of in the lower end of that kind of longer term target. It's a good segue into my next kind of round of questions, talking about data and debt services. So ICE acquired IDC a couple of years ago. So more predictable for us, easier for me to manage as a manager in terms of being able to see out as opposed to trading in clearing and settlement, which is volatility driven and you never quite know. So that's going to be a bit chunky, maybe not linear, 1% year-over-year, but something like the MOVE index, where we can take that now and start to monetize it in a way that Bank of America wouldn't have been able to. So when we do buy them, we've got to find the right value, the right index for the right value. The cost of acquiring indices, many indices is quite high. We see -- if you read stories and I had individual conversations with many of you in the audience, people say, ""Gee, my data costs are going up, and I want to pay less for data."" It's kind of a constant topic in the press right now, given the fee pressure on everybody. We're not actually seeing it. Yes. Honestly, when we gave a slightly higher guidance in there, we've built some acquisition growth to add a point or 2 of growth. You've evolved it, you added other capabilities, you made a couple of other small and niche acquisitions and added products around that.",Transcript
ICE,2020-03-02T10:25:00Z,EBIT,,,"And I think kind of underlying a lot of that M&A philosophy is, the company's -- if you try to operate ICE as an entrepreneurial company, and you're always trying to build and build. And if we can grow 5% to 6% on the top line, we're going to grow 10% on the bottom line. And now we're building the ETF hub out of it. And so it's what's the next idea that ETF hub is not going to generate growth for us this year. And so part of what we believe is, we certainly have to continue to manage and grow the existing businesses and seen us do that, which is why earnings grow every single year. And so that earnings chart we show every single quarter, we'll keep showing in that number that goes across the arrow will continue to be double-digit. And still, at the same time, try to drive the company forward and maybe make decisions that people don't necessarily understand right away. But if the $140 million can become $300 million, it can become $500 million, not all of a sudden, 2, 3, 4 years out, those are the things that are putting up and instead of us going 3% to 4%, we're going 5% to 6%. But in a couple of years, it will. But we have to continue to grow. Can it really reach a point of maturity where having an entrepreneurial mindset might become a negative rather than a positive. Like how do you take that sort of feedback? Like if you have an investor say, hey, Scott, you guys are a $50 billion market cap company, you have some very successful synergistic franchises, 60% margins, got great cash flow, just don't screw it up. So it grows 20%, you're talking about 0.5 point of growth. The mortgage business right now is $140 million out of $5 billion.

ICE,2020-09-15T11:15:00Z,Revenue,,,"And Scott, I know you've mentioned 8% to 10% grower here for the mortgage business, both next year, kind of no matter what refi looks like. And again, 8% to 10% next year assumes refi has come down 20%. And by the way, we assume it'd come down another over 30% in year 2, and we still think that we're going to be able to grow the business. And so I was hoping maybe we would spend a couple of minutes, maybe break this down into a couple of phases. And so we're confident that we can grow even if the volume environment is a bit softer. And then for the next decade plus. And what other kind of key factors here are going to get to that 8% to 10% upside over the near term? But what are you guys doing on that? I think, in my opinion, I think that originations on the mortgage side with 90% plus borrowers, still with a 50 basis point incentive to refi, would be a #1 contributor with a pretty large tail here. So in the near term, the first thing, not to pick on the question, but the growth of 8% to 10% assumes that the refis are down significantly, more than 20% actually. So it's not 8% to 10%, and refis can go to 0. So there clearly is a volume element of this business. So let me start in the near term, and then I'll move far more importantly to the medium term, the decade guide. So maybe like Phase 1 is let's call it near term, let's call it '21, 2022. What I will tell you, though, and we heard this -- I think Joe may have said it as we move through due diligence, is volumes in any given quarter or year can be a wind in the sails or a bit of a headwind, but we're in an industry where the rising tide is lifting this big boat.

For the fourth quarter, I'll note that we currently expect Ellie Mae revenues to be in the range of $220 million to $235 million, representing year-over-year growth of roughly 35% at the midpoint on a pro forma basis. My question is on the data business. They're on track to achieve, I think it's like 98% or 9% of their signings objective.

I said back in February, I thought pricing and analytics will grow 5% to 6%. I still think that's true for the year, which indicates -- I also think the revenue growth for pricing and analytics will accelerate in the back half versus the first half. Ken, it's Scott. Looking to the second half, we expect data services revenues to accelerate sequentially to between $575 million and $580 million in the third quarter, and then to increase sequentially again by an additional $7 million to $10 million in the fourth quarter. Should we expect it to continue to improve from these levels? So is the outlook here -- or what is the outlook here over the next couple of years for ASV growth? Thanks for the questions.

ICE,2018-10-31T08:30:00Z,Revenue,,,"And directly to your question, why that's still powerful is because there is very little to no incremental expense that comes with that volume growth. And so our expectation, as you've seen historically, is that as we deliver volume growth over 30% in October and as that runs through the rest of the fourth quarter, noting that it's the typical holiday quarter, and so you'll see some seasonal slowdown, that's tremendous volume growth that's based on really continued open interest growth, delivers with it high incremental margins. And so the expense growth that you'll see moving forward -- as you said, we didn't update guidance because nothing really changed other than we'll add $9 million to $10 million related to MERS, more than offset by $18 million to $20 million of revenue. And so the incremental margins are high. But I just wanted to get your sense, if we're in this environment and this -- maybe not the October levels, but kind of a better volume backdrop over the next few quarters and into '19, I mean, how should we be thinking about the incremental margin from the transaction part of the business, just because it hasn't been the big driver to growth? Good -- great question for a part of our business that, even though it's half our revenue, people seem to forget about. Obviously, October has been strong, and you didn't give any kind of update on the expense side. So I just wanted to get maybe an update on what it could mean for the margin. We've noted that over the last year, open interest has built and built and built and pointed people to when volatility hits, volumes will be there.",Transcript

And so it begins with providing more transparency, more clarity, more information, more efficiency in the market and then over time I think a question we're interested in is, can we develop tradable products out of that clearing opportunity, et cetera. And so it's still early days in determining how could that be aggregated up to help investors in the mortgage space to help somebody who's looking for a property to know more about the investment they're about to make. And that requires that you're making investments to build businesses that would generate growth 2, 3, 4 years out. And we're very focused on continuing that. But I think it's a really good example of kind of the future growth driver, '20, '21, et cetera, as you move out into the time.

On the cash equity side, it's a little less in terms of the growth in customers and the ability to change prices. One is price. So how would you evaluate the performance of that business since your Investor Day, and how have your expectations maybe changed or not changed since then? So in your 2017 Investor Day, you guys spoke to aspirations of mid- to high single-digit growth -- revenue growth for your Data Services business. That's not done for the year. Those 2 businesses, the futures part continue to see growth in new customers as the U.S. emerges as a key oil player, which drives connectivity, which drives data.

I think just on the broader data complex, I think, obviously, Scott has talked about the guidance of like 4% to 6% top line growth. I think you guys have done a really good job peeling back the annualized subscription value and how that's kind of increasing as a proportion of that data business. It's when you think about the -- what's really driving that type of performance, underneath that is a lot of new product innovation. Just trying to maybe get that revenue growth at the higher end of that range versus something closer to the midpoint. So we are constantly partnering with our customers to look at what are the needs they have from -- whether it's regulatory concerns, what are the needs they have on just understanding the portfolio constituents better, what are the type of analytics platforms that they want, and we've continued to respond and innovate to those needs. So we feel good about the 4% to 6% range.

And so just for the -- again, for those of you who aren't familiar, what we showed 2 years ago was a revenue model that effectively said, in our data business there'd be 5 key growth drivers. And so there are elements of the business that aren't necessarily subject to all elements of the revenue model, there are parts of the business that are. And so we saw an opportunity in that business to really innovate around products, to get to know the customers better to improve technology, and we thought that we could, if he did that, we could grow that business faster. And so when we closed the deal in 2015, I would say there are probably 3 or 4 key elements of the deal. And that's an expectation that we'd be able to increase price on some products each and every year. And that's how they grow. And when put it all together, it's a business that, as you said, we've guided to grow 4% to 6%. And you really made your big move into Data Services back in 2015 when you bought IDC. It was pretty big pivot for ICE at the time. It was simply through price increases. Last year second half, it grew 7%, this year, it will grow 7%. Let's circle back to Data Services broader point. Number one, it was a business that grew 2% to 3% a year, had 95% retention, you couldn't invest in bonds and not have IDC prices, but that was it. On the cash equity side, it's a little less in terms of the growth in customers and the ability to change prices. One is price.

And so our expectation, as you've seen historically, is that as we deliver volume growth over 30% in October and as that runs through the rest of the fourth quarter, noting that it's the typical holiday quarter, and so you'll see some seasonal slowdown, that's tremendous volume growth that's based on really continued open interest growth, delivers with it high incremental margins. And so the expense growth that you'll see moving forward -- as you said, we didn't update guidance because nothing really changed other than we'll add $9 million to $10 million related to MERS, more than offset by $18 million to $20 million of revenue. And so the incremental margins are high. But I just wanted to get your sense, if we're in this environment and this -- maybe not the October levels, but kind of a better volume backdrop over the next few quarters and into '19, I mean, how should we be thinking about the incremental margin from the transaction part of the business, just because it hasn't been the big driver to growth? Good -- great question for a part of our business that, even though it's half our revenue, people seem to forget about. Obviously, October has been strong, and you didn't give any kind of update on the expense side. So I just wanted to get maybe an update on what it could mean for the margin.

And it looks like the volumes almost triple what you have currently in ICE credit trade. And so it's a situation where we bought a business we think can continue to grow well by itself, but that we think we can grow faster once we put all our assets together. As I suspect you would expect, a big portion of those revenues are related to BondPoint. As you saw on Chart 12 that Jeff walked through, it's been strong growth. But again, more specifics to come when we have our fourth quarter earnings call. But more importantly, we have the opportunity for our dealer-to-dealer platform and the customers on that and the retail brokers, the wealth managers, et cetera, on BondPoint to cross-pollinate the different platforms. I know you gave a good breakout on Slide 12 of the composition. I think on a standalone basis, it could continue to grow. I think with regard to whether or not we think we could continue to grow the BondPoint business, I don't think there's any doubt. I'll give you more specifics with regards to '18 guidance once we have it. I'm just trying to sort of gauge the size of it. Maybe just some clarification, and sorry if I missed this, but of the pro forma revenue from the new acquisitions, the $93 million, how much of that was from BondPoint? Number one, I think the business itself was well positioned, particularly in the corporate and the muni space. So I just wanted to confirm that, and if you think that 40% CAGR over the last 2 years, or '16 to '17, is sustainable near term. So we haven't provided -- we gave you an aggregate of what the deals look like on a trailing 12-month basis. Yes.",Transcript

And so when you're asking why it's not growing faster, it's growing significantly faster than it did in '17. And we expect this double-digit growth in capacity and strong revenue growth to repeat in 2018. Given our outstanding listings performance in 2017 as well as a very strong start in January, we expect organic growth in listings revenue, excluding the impact of the sale of NYSE Governance Services to accelerate to 5% to 6% growth in 2018. It's worth pausing to note here that the combinations of assets we have acquired and divested during 2016 and 2017 will increase our revenues by over $30 million and reduce our expenses by around $25 million in 2018 versus our pro forma 2015 results. Just a quick one, just related to the data services revenue again. Obviously, FX right now is a little bit of a help, but I think will grow between 6% and 7% as reported and at constant currency on an organic basis. One, is the 6% to 7% growth, including any FX benefits? So first of all, the 6% to 7%, as reported or at constant currency, each, I expect, will be in that range. Yes.",Transcript

And we expect this double-digit growth in capacity and strong revenue growth to repeat in 2018. Given our outstanding listings performance in 2017 as well as a very strong start in January, we expect organic growth in listings revenue, excluding the impact of the sale of NYSE Governance Services to accelerate to 5% to 6% growth in 2018. It's worth pausing to note here that the combinations of assets we have acquired and divested during 2016 and 2017 will increase our revenues by over $30 million and reduce our expenses by around $25 million in 2018 versus our pro forma 2015 results. Just a quick one, just related to the data services revenue again. Obviously, FX right now is a little bit of a help, but I think will grow between 6% and 7% as reported and at constant currency on an organic basis.

But I think, Alex, that, as you know, it's always -- it's a very dynamic environment. But as we look at kind of the longer -- medium- to long-term trends of the business, we continue to support that 6% to 9%.

So I was just wondering if you could give us any commentary on how you feel about that 6% to 9% for fiscal year '22.

Can you just restate that again in terms of the revenue impact and then the expense impact? I think I heard you say on the Power business that it wasn't going to be material overall, and I heard the $35 million and $20 million. Once all open interest is transferred, we expect the sale to reduce annual revenues and expenses by approximately $35 million and $20 million, respectively. So if we're just looking back to 2022 and you look at it on an annual basis, we'd expect once we've closed on the sale that we see a reduction in revenues of around $35 million and approximately $20 million reduction in expenses.

And you also mentioned overall in the nontrading businesses, the overall growth rate. But our -- as I mentioned before, the growth in our investment should be outweighed by the growth of the revenue. If you combine that with pretty good growth in the other segments, are you looking at a potential of even exceeding once again the 5% to 7% growth for the target for 2020 in recurring revenue? It's above your 8% to 11% guide. So we should start to be able to demonstrate some margin expansion going into 2020 and 2021.

But on an annualized basis, we do expect to start to demonstrate that we can grow our margins along with the top line growth as we go through 2020 and -- in 2020 and 2021. But should we expect some of these margin benefits in the business to play out more in 2020 or think of more of a sustained level at a 2021 event?

In terms of our overall growth rate in market tech, we are -- we still believe that the 8% to 11% is the right way to evaluate the business going forward. Now I appreciate that this can be lumpy.

As you know, we do not issue short-term current year revenue growth guidance at Nasdaq. But as you said, it will be harder with lower growth this year. But we also have the ability to look at that in terms of making sure that we're making the right decisions around building up the teams and managing the teams so that we can try to manage to the shorter-term margin issues. For our nontrading businesses, with recurring revenues as their foundation, we have issued ranges describing where we expect organic growth in those segments to average over prospective rolling 3- to 5-year period, which we consider medium term. However, in the short term, taking into consideration all of the dynamics that I just described across our businesses, while we remain confident in the strength and resiliency of our business overall, we see increasing risks to reaching the lower end of that 5% to 7% range collectively across our nontrading segments for the full year of 2020. In terms of the margin, we are as focused as you guys are on managing the margin in the business. Our trading businesses are subject to significant external factors, such as volatility, and therefore, we do not provide any revenue outlook for our Market Services segment. Over each of the past 2 years, we have delivered organic growth from the nontrading segments at or above the top of that 5% to 7% medium-term outlook range, and we continue to believe that same range is appropriate outlook looking forward over the next 3- to 5-year period. Since early 2018, we have targeted an organic compound annual revenue growth rate across those nontrading segments collectively of 5% to 7% over that medium-term 3- to 5-year period. So we are still working towards showing an expansion of margin there. We also are -- have to make sure we're managing to our client expectations in terms of managing workload we do have. We also said that over short term -- shorter periods of time, we expect there to be data points above and below our communicated range, especially during the most impactful peaks and troughs of the economic cycle.

I know '18, '19 were big years for investing in this business. I think in the first quarter of this year, the margins in your -- the op margins in your business were about 10% or so. I'm part of Nasdaq, so margin is core of what we're focusing on. Now when we had this challenges coming over us and I see pressure on my revenue growth, it will be hard to continue to see a strong growth in the margin short term. So I'm not like a start-up where it's all about growth. So we take strong measures in making sure that our margins are going to develop positively.",Transcript

As you know, we do not issue short-term current year revenue growth guidance at Nasdaq. But as you said, it will be harder with lower growth this year. But we also have the ability to look at that in terms of making sure that we're making the right decisions around building up the teams and managing the teams so that we can try to manage to the shorter-term margin issues. For our nontrading businesses, with recurring revenues as their foundation, we have issued ranges describing where we expect organic growth in those segments to average over prospective rolling 3- to 5-year period, which we consider medium term. However, in the short term, taking into consideration all of the dynamics that I just described across our businesses, while we remain confident in the strength and resiliency of our business overall, we see increasing risks to reaching the lower end of that 5% to 7% range collectively across our nontrading segments for the full year of 2020. In terms of the margin, we are as focused as you guys are on managing the margin in the business. Our trading businesses are subject to significant external factors, such as volatility, and therefore, we do not provide any revenue outlook for our Market Services segment. Over each of the past 2 years, we have delivered organic growth from the nontrading segments at or above the top of that 5% to 7% medium-term outlook range, and we continue to believe that same range is appropriate outlook looking forward over the next 3- to 5-year period. Since early 2018, we have targeted an organic compound annual revenue growth rate across those nontrading segments collectively of 5% to 7% over that medium-term 3- to 5-year period. So we are still working towards showing an expansion of margin there. We also are -- have to make sure we're managing to our client expectations in terms of managing workload we do have. We also said that over short term -- shorter periods of time, we expect there to be data points above and below our communicated range, especially during the most impactful peaks and troughs of the economic cycle.

But when we think about margin, you guys have been operating historically in the high 40s area. I guess, how do kind of balance spending for growth versus kind of being aware of your margin profile versus kind of the exchange peers in the industry? If we can continue to grow that effectively, that's 3- to 5-year period, continue to manage our expenses, and again, we set a target of around 3% plus or minus target for that. It's about resource allocation. Just continue to focus on faster revenue growth, compared to managing expenses. Our ultimate target is a double-digit total shareholder return. So again, we haven't set a basic margin target. So if we can grow our revenue at faster pace than grow our expenses, you should see the resulting line within -- the margins exceed the benefit of the margin expansion.

Is this a 12-month thing, a 24-month thing? Number two, I would say the banks and brokers, there -- we think that we can help the banks and brokers save cost by, taking a noncore technology platform off of their hands and be able to provide them with the technology for them. Primarily, now they're clearing systems. So as opposed to talking about the different conversions, what I can say is from a growth opportunity standpoint, we definitely see -- are very excited about the buy-side opportunity that there is, obviously, a lot of clients on the surveillance side that we can offer those services, too. So in '18 and '19, we had significant investment. So that creates a lot of opportunity in there. So there continues to be a lot of opportunity within existing clients plus also new clients coming to the market. So we can save them a lot of money.

And overall, we're at 4% so far this year, and we continue to find opportunities to grow and expand that business. And so there are -- there's established pricing that we're working on and making sure that the clients are seeing it as a subscription service. And so what we are looking at is how do we just -- obviously, we have our own internal targets. And then for Corporate Services, we have said that that's a low single-digit grower as a general matter.

But if you can talk about what you envision as the revenue expectations, and maybe too early to the second half this year, but certainly coming into 2018 and if that alters your long-term mid-single-digit growth outlook in Info Services at all.

In Analytics Hub, it's a whole new thing. It is -- in a way, it's kind of an interesting project for us. It's a very -- it's a new space.

And so what we are looking at is how do we just -- obviously, we have our own internal targets. And then for Corporate Services, we have said that that's a low single-digit grower as a general matter. Because when you're going into a highly competitive space where you kind of know what the total addressable market is and you're trying to grab at it, it's easier for you to come up with projections as to -- if I progress this way, I will get this money. But I appreciate all the color on this. But I guess what's the outlook on the top line? But if you can talk about -- I know it's early. But if you can talk about what you envision as the revenue expectations, and maybe too early to the second half this year, but certainly coming into 2018 and if that alters your long-term mid-single-digit growth outlook in Info Services at all. But in terms of our expectations and how quickly these targets will be met, we are not providing those publicly because we do want to have more experience with the technology and with our customers to know what fits their needs and how they're going to be adopting it before we give you any sort of true, clear guidance or outlook on that particular part of the business. But we don't yet have targets that we're able to communicate to you. I know you're making margin improvement from Corporate Services, but it seems like these other segments are still below that mid-single-digit number that you sort of put out there as guidance prior. I think with regard to our Information Services business, as you've seen, that has obviously had a nice growth this quarter with the growth in our AUM as well as just continued growth in our proprietary products. In Analytics Hub, it's a whole new thing. It is -- in a way, it's kind of an interesting project for us. It's a very -- it's a new space. It's something -- these are products that clients have never had access to before. Market Technology was huge in the first quarter, and you acknowledge it's going to be volatile. So I feel very comfortable with our mid-single-digit outlook for that business as well. So I guess the first question is on -- getting away from the efficiencies, but on the top line and the organic growth of the non-trading segments. So as we look at the first half of the year and because of the volatility, we do tend to look at as the year progresses as opposed to each quarter alone. So the total addressable market, in a way, is kind of unknown. So what I would say with Market Technology, as we've been saying, and I said it in the first quarter even with that strong growth in that one quarter, that we have outlook, a long-range outlook, of mid to high single digits for the Market Technology business, and we continue to support that. That sound like sort of exciting new area. We are doing this as a subscription. We have had 10% growth in that business, and we continue to feel that, that supports our mid to high single-digit overall outlook for the business. Well, I would say I think we need to have more experience with it and working with the clients very extensively to understand the total breadth of the opportunity.",Transcript

And so I would say that that investment is ongoing. And so that is a concentrated effort, and it's kind of looking at how we allocate our CapEx, not necessarily increasing our total CapEx, but how we allocate it towards the business that we know we can grow. And then the second part of that was obviously around the markets, right, I mean, you guys are investing in -- I think, on the last call, you talked about, look, this is a business that you're seeing a lot of runway for growth on the top line, but it will probably require some incremental investment. But I would say that as we go into '18 and coming out of the strategic review, we said this is the area that we want to make sure we're making significant technology investment in, to get the Nasdaq Financial Framework fully up and running across all of the components. But it will therefore create a catalyst for us to expand our margins and become more of a managed service provider in the medium to long term. So we have been making a conscious effort to invest in the business. So we're in this sort of process and the opportunity to drive margin expansion in that part of it...",Transcript

But ultimately, that should be able to result in better margins for the business. Now, it takes some investment upfront and so there is some investment in order to move us in that direction. So the more that we can move our business to SaaS-based platforms, we've already done this in our surveillance business, which is a SaaS-based platform, where you build the tool and then you can then sell the same sort of technology multiple times, that should improve the overall margin of the company.",Transcript

So, long-term recurring revenue type contracts and same thing of corporate solutions business now long term, but people are on annual contracts. So, this next slide breaks down our revenue growth and you can see that we break it into the two components. The first component is the non-trading segments and that has been growing in the 4% to 6% range over the last number of years. When you see our market tech business, specifically has revenues that are on five-year to seven-year contracts.",Transcript

From an organic revenue standpoint growth, when we look at our non-trading segments, they grow in that mid-single-digit range. It has a very strong network effect with respect to that and because they are the leader. It's a very important tool for many people to have. It's been growing in 12% to 13% annually and we do believe it can continue to achieve double-digit revenue growth going forward for the medium term at least. They are very scalable, SaaS-oriented business with resilient and growing revenue. You could see the chart talks about 4% to 6%, and that's where we think the business can continue to grow over the medium term.",Transcript

And that's assuming that we have about a 5% to 7% growth rate within our non-transactional side of the business. I think -- at least within the Market Technology segment, I think you're talking about the 2- to 3-year sort of investment horizon. Is that applied to the whole company in terms of where you think, say, by 2020, you'll have that framework firmly in place and be able to scale it and leverage it from there? Maybe just talk about the timing. Maybe just to move back to the Nasdaq Financial Framework. So overall, what we said is over the next 3 to 5 years, we're looking to try and maintain our cost around the -- approximately around the 3% range, 2% increase range over the next 3 to 5 years. So there is a significant investment over the next couple of years.

Revenues have been a little soft in the last couple of quarters after seeing, I guess, a little bit of recovery last year.

As we get full travel in 2023, you would think that we could bring in a big chunk of additional EFT revenue next year just to get to where we were for travel in '19. But when travel comes back all the way, next year, I've got a big bump there, too. I mean you've got to remember that if we could hit our number that we hope for this year, which is 2019's number, that will be with a change in both epay and Money Transfer, adding they're probably going to be coming in $100 million in EBITDA more than they did in '19 this year. I was just trying to figure out, if you could just summarize the components of the business you think are still reeling underwater and by the magnitude from an EPS standpoint relative to what they should be, if we didn't have a pandemic. I'm adding more ATMs, I'm going into more countries, et cetera. In other words, versus '19, but more importantly, even if we didn't have -- it would have grown for '19. No, I think that's a really good point. So cross-border. So that's my kind of ace up my sleeve for next year. So that's what's kind of exciting as I've got business as usual growth in all the segments. So this is kind of a 1, 2 punch for the next 2 years.

As we work through this chaos and when we get more normalized travel trends, I mean that's just -- like Rick says, we get 80-plus percent of that next transaction revenue fall straight to the pretax line across that same ATM estate. But in early April, we all thought the Russian invasion of Ukraine would be short term. But just curious to hear your thoughts and the potential framework and how to think about that going forward. But let's not forget, we're going to end up with a very good second half for epay, Money Transfer continues to gain market share. I wanted to -- it's a little bit early to talk about next year, but I think it might be helpful just to level set how you think about earnings growth in a ""normalized environment"", whatever that means these days and then what factors above and beyond what would we consider normalized earnings should we consider for next year? Obviously, you still have the travel recovery to go next year, which should be incremental to add up boost. Our ATMs and our teams are ready to serve these customers. Probably the biggest hit -- the biggest contribution to our earnings growth next year is going to be travel. REN continues to pick up. So I mean, we've got a whole lot of growth levers for next year in addition to which is kind of like low-hanging fruit and that's just getting the travel industry back on its feet. So that's our -- that's our -- will be our single largest contributor next year. We are confident in our business model and believe that our growth will continue to improve as the travel industry reestablishes their staffing and operational levels to those of pre-COVID. We are pleased with the rebound of the ATM business as travel around the globe continues to become less restricted. We have proven again that our fundamental business proposition is intact and we expect to be able to continue strong growth rates. We see the Piraeus Bank Merchant Acquiring business growing very nicely. We're getting closer and closer to closing some big Dandelion deals there. Yes, it'd be good at some point to get an update on the mix of the overall EFT segment just because you have added some -- a lot of new products there, but we can connect off-line on that.",Transcript

So certainly since October, the Federal Reserve has been reducing the size of its balance sheet. So that by 2021, I think the $1.3 trillion reduction in the balance sheet that they're looking for. So this has been largely loss like NASDAQ, it's $4 trillion position. This should have a very gradual positive impact on the need for additional hedging.",Transcript

And if you look at that growth coming from almost equally from our Eurodollars as well as our Treasuries, on the Eurodollar side, up more than 30%; Treasury is also up more than 30% in terms of the futures complex. And last year, the United States surpassed Saudi Arabia in terms of production, with more than 10 million barrels per day being produced. And then I'm just trying to understand what has really changed since 2012 that has really helped to kind of the share gains reaccelerate and the growth reaccelerate? But now the Federal Reserve being more active and expected to be more active this year, so a positive tailwind. Certainly, there's a different volatility environment, but also something -- the lifting of the oil export ban in the U.S. Greatly appreciate it. I guess, we're just trying to understand, how significant has that been for WTI as a contract and as a benchmark? I mean, it's averaging close to 1.4 million contracts, just from the futures alone, per day in 2018, versus just 600,000 contracts per day just 4 years ago in 2014. I think we ran the numbers, and February ADV in interest rates is up 50% year-on-year. I think we've looked at it and tried to identify what's really accelerating the growth here. I wouldn't say it's back to historical norms, but certainly, there's changing expectations for rates, which I think has probably been a positive for hedging activity and speculation and repositioning. If you look at our Fed funds futures, in particular our FedWatch tool, which is very popular, actually the most popular website that we have, there is expected to be a greater than 70% probability for tightenings this year and particularly by the December meeting. In fact, there's been shipments of oil to Asia, shipments of oil to Middle East, of all places. In terms of the interest rate growth, obviously, a better cyclical environment. Meanwhile, there was a revolution that occurred in technology which allowed the easier extraction and more thorough extraction of oil from the wells, and that was a fracking revolution. Really appreciate, actually, everyone's time. So Sean, do you mind giving us some more color as to what clients you're seeing come in and really driving the strong volume growth in the rates complex in February. So first, I guess, I want to start with, really, on the market environment. So thank you for giving us your time this afternoon. So that is a nice tailwind. So the United States is awash in oil. So to put it into context, last year, as we passed Saudi Arabia, that was the largest amount of oil produced in the United States since the 1970s. So what you've seen recently is -- and there was an article in Reuters, which was referring to the Energy Information Administration's statistics. So what's really the underlying driver and who's driving that growth? That, you kind of brought in the Brent-WTI spread during that period of time. There's been more interest rate volatility to start the year. They anticipate in 2018, this year, 11 million barrels a day to be produced. They, through trucking and through rail, made it much smoother to get through Cushing, Oklahoma. We've lived through 0 interest rate policy, and we continued to grow the complex through 0 interest rate policy for a number of years. With the lifting of the crude oil ban, it really tied the U.S. markets to the global markets. Yes, in terms of that, the rates complex up more than 34% this year.

So I would say that the growth rate, as you look at all the dynamics of what's going on, and largely due to the SIP being a -- such a large base of overall nontransaction fees, and if you look at it from a drag on growth rate, that's probably one of the biggest reasons that we would expect a, call it, low to mid-single-digit growth rate in nontransaction revenue. That tends to necessarily get repriced or adjusted to reflect how the users are using those services as well as the greater capacity or whatever the benefits that are associated with it. We expect SIP market data revenue to be relatively unchanged year-over-year in 2019, absent auto recoveries and assuming no significant changes in market share.",Transcript
CBOE.K,2019-11-01T08:30:00Z,EBIT,,,"A lot of times the margin on that incremental revenue is in excess of 100%, which we did in this quarter. And I'm sure the team's looking at me and they probably don't want me to. And a measure I do like to look at is, as you look at performance, is what is the margin on the incremental revenues over different periods in this particular quarter. And again, that is not something is inconsistent -- or said a better way, it is something we would expect to see in an environment where we're seeing synergies starting to show up in an organization over the long term. And again, that's a short-term impact, more of 2020, as we carry some of the costs of both locations, really preparing ourselves for much more efficient '21 and '22, which is actually one of the whole -- one of the primary reasons of moving the headquarter's location and the trading floor is that this is a long-term benefit that we will achieve that won't show up on the expense side in 2020. And if you back out some of those items, the EBITDA margin was probably closer to that. And that is reflective of the activities that we're doing, the cost discipline and a bunch of different circumstances. And you see this a lot -- or certainly we've seen this when you introduce synergies and you're becoming more efficient. As we think about 2020 and that expense outlook, is it possible to improve on this margin or do you view this third quarter as a high point? But again, that's just something that we want to provide some clarity on as far as that reconciliation coming out of '19 into '20. But again, that's nice to claim in any one quarter when it goes up like this. But anyway, so let's talk about the improved margin. But as with all scale businesses, when you see that incremental tick-up in volume in any one period of time, you'd better see a very efficient margin on that incremental revenue, which I think we've been able to continue to demonstrate over time. It probably declined by 150 basis points roughly of that 68.5% to 69% versus closer to the 71% that we reported. Maybe just if we could go back on the expenses for 2020 and to think about it in a different lens, in an adjusted operating margin lens. On the duplicate expenses, we'll provide a little more guidance to that as we roll in on the next earnings call as far as the overall order of magnitude and how that impacts the run rate. So I'm going try and maybe duplicate the -- or excuse me, duplicate, I'll try to group the expense questions together, hopefully hit those, and then I think we'll move to trading volumes/improvements to liquidity as the last item we'll try to address. So our retargeting excess of 70% margin in the future, that would be great to achieve, but that's not something we're driving. So solid margin this quarter. So the margin that we have is that we have a margin threshold, and we don't manage the business by, ""I have to have x percent of EBITDA margin."" Again, they are a short-term measure of how effective you were in maybe a particular quarter or over a period of time and so we're looking at that -- I think it's better to look at margins over -- at least on an annual basis versus any one quarter. There were certainly activities that we did to earn that income. We had some, if you look at, for example, we had some other income that hit this quarter that aren't kind of always part of the core run rate of what we're doing. When we go into growth mode and we put in investment mode, there may be some quarters where that margin may be slightly lower.",Transcript

And if that continues, I would expect that our volumes will reflect the continuation of those various strategies. And it's one of the drivers you talked about, premium harvesting was maybe one of them. And that's what's up.

And that's just been great. And the tools that we brought to the marketplace for hedging allows you to express any interest in that hedge going forward.

And what has happened probably over the last 18 months, Debbie has a really cool slide, Slide 13 on our deck, if you have it around, that really shows the decoupling of our volumes in the index complex if you overlay the level of VIX. And what has happened up until about 18 months ago is we relied on higher VIX levels for volume. And what he's been able to accomplish and prepare us ultimately for the first major migration of our futures exchange to Bats' technology, on target for February 25. And what you're seeing is an energized company where we're rolling out new products. But I'll stick with your question on volatility and what we've seen and the uniqueness of the mix and the interaction when we look at the index complex as a whole. But on the flip side, you guys have seen great growth in areas around fixed. But this year, it has been a solid trade. Doesn't mean it will be in '18. I mentioned synergy realization has been on track, even accelerated. I think that's the best way to get a view of volatility, not just looking at fixed futures, not just looking at fixed options, but including the look into SPX. I think the future is complex. I think what we've been able to accomplish in that stack around market data is interesting. I think what's shockingly, and is awesome, is to look at the projections that Chris Isaacson, our CIO, made in diligence. I'm talking about this great run-up since the election to today. It's absolutely amazing to me how he saw that vision, what he needed to get done. Or when you think about when that transaction was announced like the ultimate, like what the firm, the new firm, can deliver, like where are we in that process? Out-of-the-money VIX calls should outperform any other hedging vehicle for exposure to the 500. So I guess, just any comments on that and maybe a little bit of color in terms of what's been happening because on one hand, given the volatility backdrop, people would expect volume to be extremely muted, and there are areas like cash equities that has been muted. So even before we announced to all of you our deal and before we closed at the end of February and, really, the first of March of this year, Chris Isaacson laid out a technology migration roadmap that was absolutely stunningly accurate. So have there been any, say, challenges? So it's truly an energized company in the middle of its biggest integration task ever. So just looking at volatility across the board, I think you're right. So maybe first, just to start off, since the deal closing, organic growth has been healthy. So no, it's been exceptional when I look at -- the big fear going in was we're going to be in integration mode and stuck in integration mode for 2, 3 years. So part of the integration is already happening. So the difference between capturing implied and realized is showing up in our market.

And we're launching a future on that same index. Another quote was, ""I have a futures exchange."" Now I will go back and amend that quote. But there was a time when iBoxx was -- and both market and iShares very focused on growing the AUM of that ETF. I guess, can you talk about the -- what you do with market and BlackRock in this -- on the new products on ICE. I haven't found that example anywhere else on the planet. I think now it's obvious we think the future will complement the ETF, certainly will complement the trading in the ETF. It would say that -- the quote was, ""Ed and I now have a futures exchange."" But you do have a futures exchange, and you've just announced a nice partnership. It's -- there's a couple of firsts here.

More importantly, we're creating the first future on a broad U.S. bond market index, and that doesn't exist either. Most importantly, there's an underlying liquidity pool, [now] market makers that make up the market in the iBoxx ETFs. So there's a demand over the counter. So we think we have a very attractive initial liquidity pool, with a great opportunity to grow that product throughout the fixed income arena. So when we mentioned that to people, they're a little bit startled to hear that this is the first future on a U.S. bond index. That's unique. The ETF is established. The cost of that is high. The index is established. The individual margin that you have to put up is getting higher as regulations kick in. The over-the-counter swap market in iBoxx is about $15 billion market. They would have thought it was created before. This is, I believe, the first we actually -- the future is lagging the ETF.

So, as we look over the next few years, what do you see the biggest opportunities for growth? So, really the story for us if it's dollar-denominated global risk, you can trade that at the CBOE, and then as far as volatility goes, being able to further the volatility story and VIX as the global benchmark for all things volatility does that distribution in those channels, it's such an amazing opportunity for us. So, that extension is what we're really looking forward to. So, the strategic behind that was the diversification, not only of asset class in picking up US and European equities as well as FX, but also from a geography standpoint, being able to pick up a business development force which is much more present in London. That's really, I think, what we'll continue to talk about over the next few years. The opportunity continues to be driving CBOE's proprietary index complex and our volatility complex.

I don't know if they'll come back, but I would anticipate in this market environment that the structure is perfect for those strategies. I think what we'll see in this marketplaces and I say it's -- we're setting up and had begun to see -- if you remember the $0.50 premium option hedging strategy that was really, really common for us last year -- those trades are coming back into the marketplace where, and I reference VVIX is really a good look for you all into the relative price of hedging with VIX, versus a skew, which might give you a pretty good look of the relative cost of hedging with SPX. So I expect to see that, that volume either come back and then grow as a result. The market's setting up for that trade as well. We expect continued growth in proprietary market data in 2018 as we benefit from pricing changes and customer response to our Cboe 1 product. We see the VVIX lining up, and then we've seen the 50,000 lot trader come back into the marketplace. Well, that's a great question.

It's the most liquid form to get in and out of on the option side. One thing that, I think, a lot of people miss in the multi-list space is the volume associated with options on ETFs is exceptional. Over 50% of the multi-list options volume is options on ETF. So again, we have the migration of C2, which should help our multi-list business.

So, as we look over the next few years, what do you see the biggest opportunities for growth? So, really the story for us if it's dollar-denominated global risk, you can trade that at the CBOE, and then as far as volatility goes, being able to further the volatility story and VIX as the global benchmark for all things volatility does that distribution in those channels, it's such an amazing opportunity for us. So, that extension is what we're really looking forward to. So, the strategic behind that was the diversification, not only of asset class in picking up US and European equities as well as FX, but also from a geography standpoint, being able to pick up a business development force which is much more present in London. That's really, I think, what we'll continue to talk about over the next few years. The opportunity continues to be driving CBOE's proprietary index complex and our volatility complex.

And as you know, there are tag-along or copycat strategies that go along with the 50,000 lot trade and a smaller version of the million-contract hedge for the unknown unknowns. I don't know if they'll come back, but I would anticipate in this market environment that the structure is perfect for those strategies. I think what we'll see in this marketplaces and I say it's -- we're setting up and had begun to see -- if you remember the $0.50 premium option hedging strategy that was really, really common for us last year -- those trades are coming back into the marketplace where, and I reference VVIX is really a good look for you all into the relative price of hedging with VIX, versus a skew, which might give you a pretty good look of the relative cost of hedging with SPX. So I expect to see that, that volume either come back and then grow as a result. The market's setting up for that trade as well. We expect continued growth in proprietary market data in 2018 as we benefit from pricing changes and customer response to our Cboe 1 product. We see the VVIX lining up, and then we've seen the 50,000 lot trader come back into the marketplace. Well, that's a great question.

And so we're -- we did quite well in 2017 in multi-list. And then we have, obviously, the migration of the C1 platform, which is the CBOE mother ship of options. It's the most liquid form to get in and out of on the option side. One thing that, I think, a lot of people miss in the multi-list space is the volume associated with options on ETFs is exceptional. Over 50% of the multi-list options volume is options on ETF. So again, we have the migration of C2, which should help our multi-list business. So if you track the growth of ETFs in the U.S. which is exceptional, there is a huge driver of the multi-list business. That was the first step of, what we call, our migration because that multi-list Complex Order Book is what's going to be delivered on the C2 migration, which is scheduled for May 14 of this year. We saw some growth there both in terms of market share and in terms of combined top line revenue. We're off to a great start, obviously, in this heightened volatility.",Transcript

CBOE.K,2017-12-06T09:20:00Z,Revenue,,,"And -- but it still feels like there's a broader usage and broader utilization of the proprietary products that CBOE's has been offering. And I guess starting with CBOE's proprietary product, and Ed may have talked a little bit about it before. And I guess, if we were to see a sudden spike in volatility, is there a much in risk in terms of what's been such a big tailwind for you guys this year? And if that continues, I would expect that our volumes will reflect the continuation of those various strategies. And it's one of the drivers you talked about, premium harvesting was maybe one of them. And that's what's up. But sitting here, last year, if we were to say, look, VIX is going to be down 30% over the course of the year, I don't think many people would've thought that a lot of your proprietary products would be up 20%. Every selloff looks to be still a buying opportunity. I think that continues in this market environment. So it's not just taking premium out of the market, it is also the ability to just isolate that unknown event. So maybe help us understand, I guess, 2 things, a, how big of a driver do you think the premium harvesting strategies have been on the tailwind for -- over the course of the year? So we benefited on both, all-out exposure and hedge, and then capturing the difference between implied and realized. That has been the theme of the last, at least, 12 to 14 months. We've seen that throughout the year, that continues. Where are you seeing incremental uptick, in the uptake of the products? You know that it's out there and out of the money calls is the best way to express that.",Transcript

CBOE.K,2017-11-15T10:45:00Z,Revenue,,,"And Chris reminds me that, well, he's done this before and this is not his first migration and he totally gets it. And Chris, I think it's important to note that even as U.S. equity -- volumes have been dampened a bit because of volatility. And that difference is a great trade and it has been in 2017. And that's just been great. And the tools that we brought to the marketplace for hedging allows you to express any interest in that hedge going forward. And then -- and second, move from active to passive at 25%. And to your point, even in 2017, which has been an unusually low, from an historical perspective, volatility level, we've enjoyed terrific growth across the index complex. And usually responds with the -- he looks at me he's like he's the challenge in this deal. And we'd go through some slow summer months and say, well, when vol comes back, so, too, will volumes. And what has happened probably over the last 18 months, Debbie has a really cool slide, Slide 13 on our deck, if you have it around, that really shows the decoupling of our volumes in the index complex if you overlay the level of VIX. And what has happened up until about 18 months ago is we relied on higher VIX levels for volume. And what he's been able to accomplish and prepare us ultimately for the first major migration of our futures exchange to Bats' technology, on target for February 25. And what you're seeing is an energized company where we're rolling out new products. But I'll stick with your question on volatility and what we've seen and the uniqueness of the mix and the interaction when we look at the index complex as a whole. But on the flip side, you guys have seen great growth in areas around fixed. But this year, it has been a solid trade. Doesn't mean it will be in '18. I mentioned synergy realization has been on track, even accelerated. I think that's the best way to get a view of volatility, not just looking at fixed futures, not just looking at fixed options, but including the look into SPX. I think the future is complex. I think what we've been able to accomplish in that stack around market data is interesting. I think what's shockingly, and is awesome, is to look at the projections that Chris Isaacson, our CIO, made in diligence. I'm talking about this great run-up since the election to today. It's absolutely amazing to me how he saw that vision, what he needed to get done. Or when you think about when that transaction was announced like the ultimate, like what the firm, the new firm, can deliver, like where are we in that process? Out-of-the-money VIX calls should outperform any other hedging vehicle for exposure to the 500. So I guess, just any comments on that and maybe a little bit of color in terms of what's been happening because on one hand, given the volatility backdrop, people would expect volume to be extremely muted, and there are areas like cash equities that has been muted. So even before we announced to all of you our deal and before we closed at the end of February and, really, the first of March of this year, Chris Isaacson laid out a technology migration roadmap that was absolutely stunningly accurate. So have there been any, say, challenges? So it's truly an energized company in the middle of its biggest integration task ever. So just looking at volatility across the board, I think you're right. So maybe first, just to start off, since the deal closing, organic growth has been healthy. So no, it's been exceptional when I look at -- the big fear going in was we're going to be in integration mode and stuck in integration mode for 2, 3 years. So part of the integration is already happening. So the difference between capturing implied and realized is showing up in our market. So too is the power of hedging exposure to the S&P 500 when your only real risk is a meaningful move in the market, not a slight correction. So what's happening? Technology integratio",Transcript

Yes, anything to do with the future, I will answer tomorrow, because whether it's the next year or longer term, I think if we're able to discuss in the frame of the strategic planning, you will know where we think the opportunities are, where we think the investment is going to be and where you think the risk potentially going to lie and where the upside is.

But in terms of the investment income, I think has been going up and down for a variety of reasons. But we did make quite a few changes last year and with the way we're using external fund managers. Congratulation to the record-high profit, it's very great. Interest rate seems to have been leveled off. Just wonder, we can see whether -- what -- because it is already the record-high profit this year, so can you explain to us what will be the next driving force should bring it higher? So basically, we look at anything above the $1 billion as a good outcome. So the margin requirements have gone up to 7%, they have come down to 6%, they have come down to 5%.

And then secondly, just on the balance sheet, you've highlighted you expect to achieve 1 times gross leverage in the medium term. Does the Deutsche Boerse and LSE previous revenue targets still stand independent of the merger? I guess it's too early to say, but I was wondering if there's anything you can share on longer-term target pro-forma gross leverage. I understand that your revenue targets are completely incremental, but in the prospectus it says that the 2018 revenue guidance as provided under Deutsche Boerse is no longer valid under the HoldCo agreement. I'll just make a quick intro comment regarding the clearing thing around Deutsche Boerse. On the LSE side I was just wondering if you have any plans to do the same at LCH either prior to the deal closing or perhaps immediately afterwards. So I'm wondering if that's something technical. So it's still in the range of EUR2.8b to EUR3.2b and this does not change with regard to that. So we still confirm our 2018 revenue guidance what we gave to you at Deutsche Boerse. The first is I understand Deutsche Boerse is proactively taking action to increase the level of capital it has in the Eurex clearing default waterfall. We are planning to move from EUR315m to EUR365m over the coming year and that's the change that Martin is referring to. Yes.",Transcript
DB1GnEUR.xbo,2017-02-16T13:00:00Z,Revenue,,,"And secondly, if you could give us an update on the OTC clearing revenue outlook for 2017 and 2018 please? Any change in your view on the size of that within that range? Any changes in the timing of it particular, I'm guessing things like the sort of the OTC clearing proportion has been a bit delayed, whether there are any other moving parts that you'd highlight. Can you elaborate a bit on the reasons for that. Given where we sit now, I wonder if you could provide an update on that. I had a question on the part of the Accelerate program targeted EUR300 million to EUR500 million of incremental revenue opportunities out to 2018. Obviously, it was quite a wide range that EUR300 million to EUR500 million. So due to the uncertainty in the market, the market volume really dropped and you see the development in all our competitors too. So far we are fully on track to deliver our 5% to 10% revenue growth every year, so we have delivered that in 2016, you have read our guidance for 2017 and for 2018, it's basically the same. So we expect double-digit growth rates on our commodity business, European Energy Exchange where we increased our revenues up to [EUR216 million] now though we continued trend from off exchange to on exchange, our market share on exchange is now above 30% and we expect that this increase of on exchange will continue to increase over the next years. So we expect growth in the OTC clearing space and changed our view that we want to achieve some EUR50 million in 2018, [during] 2017 it will be a double-digit million euro number but clearly below that level in the transformational phase. So we see that the structural elements where we can grow will increase over time compared to the cyclical elements. So we see the general trend from OTC to on exchange, our concrete offer is to implement a central limit order book facility mid of 2017. So we want to achieve a 5% to 10% net revenue growth rate and a 10% to 15% earnings growth. So we were able to even increase our trading volume despite the other decrease. So, our view looking forward is unchanged. The good thing is that 360T gained some market share. The reason for that was we were faced with headwind from market volume overall. We will link that as a clearing solution, so we will make attractive offers to our customers and we expect that we will double-digit growth rates on 360T. Where does it come from? With regard to 360T, yes, the revenue were flattish and are behind plan. Yes, thanks for the question Daniel.",Transcript
DB1GnEUR.xbo,2017-06-14T10:30:00Z,Revenue,,,"And in addition to the synergies we create out of our trading and clearing capabilities on Eurex, we expect overall to grow that business for the next years by 20%. And in the second half year, we will offer tradings or central limit order book functionality, including clearing functionality. And so we expect at that point of time when this central bank money policy changes that you will also see an increase in issuance of bonds in euro. And there are other new ideas like total-return futures what we have. And we calculated the impact for the industry, for market participants, and customers CSDs in the range of EUR 30 million to EUR 70 million on an annual basis just pooling all these cash collateral securities at Clearstream. And we expect revenue growth within the next 3 years of 25% on a per annual basis. And we expect to grow in that business. And we really are convinced that this is a strong driver to bring business from today OTC to on exchange. But as you are all aware, beginning from next year, there are new reporting requirements according to MiFID II. On average, we expect net revenue growth of around 10% over the next 3 years. Overall, we expect in this data segment an increase on average of 10% per annum. Overall, we expect that this business will grow 5% to 10% over the next 3 years. Reporting services is a new growth area. So U.S. dollar denominated bond issuance, yes, that increased, but euro is basically flattish due to the EC bank policy. So far, there are requirements with regard to EMEA. So for our customers, we want to build up here a one-stop solution, so helping our clients to do that reporting, that would be a nice growth area for us. So overall, we expect in this new product 15% CAGR or plus EUR 50 million until 2019. So that is the structural component, what we see here. So there is no doubt, there is a sustained trend and strong growth in passive investments, passive assets, so market expects 15% annual growth until 2020. That 360T, we introduced in Q2, a new distribution channel or ECN, so we started with a request for growth now of an ECN structure. We expect net revenue will grow on an average rate of 10% for the next years, and the EBITDA margin is currently on a level of 50%. We expect that 360T will grow on an annual basis by roughly 10%. We want to expand our regional presence of our STOXX family and increase direct sales coverage with buy-side clients.",Transcript

DB1GnEUR.xbo,2017-10-27T13:00:00Z,Revenue,,,"And I refer to in my -- speaking at the beginning, just to remind us again, so OTC interest rate swap clearing is a good opportunity where we expect nice growth. And in this difficult environment, it's even good to show them 4% to 5% increase. And secondly, you flagged in your short -- very short Q3 report that you are giving -- generating and expecting a USD 50 million gain from a transaction portfolio optimization. And so overall, that's not a bad development, what we see here at 360T. And that's also our expectation that even on a stand-alone basis, so we should see better growth rate in 2018 compared to 2017. And that's the reason why, even if you did some nice price increases on a net basis, you don't see it in our RPC numbers. And therefore, we are able to show that increase, so that means we are able to further gain additional market shares, as our main competitors on a year-to-date basis are basically flattish. And we also expect for the next year that -- some cyclical -- from a cyclical perspective, we see tailwind instead of headwind. At Clearstream, 2018 will be the first full year where clients have the opportunity to benefit from TARGET2-Securities by pooling their custody business in one CSD. At Eurex, secular areas where we expect growth for next year include OTC clearing, continued product innovation, commodities trading at the European Energy Exchange, and the trading and clearing of FX product at 360T. But as also now, we have a lower starting point in 2017. But in general, we say, look, we want to grow net revenue by 5% to 10%. FX business, we expect double-digit growth; Investment Funds Services, index business, so new products at Eurex, TARGET2-Securities, so there are many initiatives around that. First of all, could you just give us an indication what triggers your confidence for the strong growth of 360T? Firstly, on your secular growth. For 2018, we expect further growth through a growing number of funds on our platform and a larger market share. For FX product at 360T, we expect a bright future because we will increasingly realize revenue synergies generated from fully electronic trading and clearing of currency terms. For commodity trading at EEX, we expect the temporary causes for depressed volumes to fade until the end of the year and the catch-up of volumes next year. Given that the historic low equity market volatility persisted in the third quarter, we are very likely not going to achieve the lower end of our net revenue and earnings guidance for the full year. If we are in all of these areas successful, then it could be more than 5% structural growth rate in 2018.

Right now, you have an underlying secular growth of around 5%. So for the first question, 360T development, so currently, on a global basis, FX market is under pressure.

And in this difficult environment, it's even good to show them 4% to 5% increase. And secondly, you flagged in your short -- very short Q3 report that you are giving -- generating and expecting a USD 50 million gain from a transaction portfolio optimization. And so overall, that's not a bad development, what we see here at 360T. And that's also our expectation that even on a stand-alone basis, so we should see better growth rate in 2018 compared to 2017. And that's the reason why, even if you did some nice price increases on a net basis, you don't see it in our RPC numbers. And therefore, we are able to show that increase, so that means we are able to further gain additional market shares, as our main competitors on a year-to-date basis are basically flattish. And we also expect for the next year that -- some cyclical -- from a cyclical perspective, we see tailwind instead of headwind. At Clearstream, 2018 will be the first full year where clients have the opportunity to benefit from TARGET2-Securities by pooling their custody business in one CSD. At Eurex, secular areas where we expect growth for next year include OTC clearing, continued product innovation, commodities trading at the European Energy Exchange, and the trading and clearing of FX product at 360T. But as also now, we have a lower starting point in 2017. But in general, we say, look, we want to grow net revenue by 5% to 10%. FX business, we expect double-digit growth; Investment Funds Services, index business, so new products at Eurex, TARGET2-Securities, so there are many initiatives around that. First of all, could you just give us an indication what triggers your confidence for the strong growth of 360T? Firstly, on your secular growth. For 2018, we expect further growth through a growing number of funds on our platform and a larger market share. For FX product at 360T, we expect a bright future because we will increasingly realize revenue synergies generated from fully electronic trading and clearing of currency terms. For commodity trading at EEX, we expect the temporary causes for depressed volumes to fade until the end of the year and the catch-up of volumes next year. Given that the historic low equity market volatility persisted in the third quarter, we are very likely not going to achieve the lower end of our net revenue and earnings guidance for the full year. If we are in all of these areas successful, then it could be more than 5% structural growth rate in 2018.

And then secondly, just on the balance sheet, you've highlighted you expect to achieve 1 times gross leverage in the medium term. Does the Deutsche Boerse and LSE previous revenue targets still stand independent of the merger? I guess it's too early to say, but I was wondering if there's anything you can share on longer-term target pro-forma gross leverage. I understand that your revenue targets are completely incremental, but in the prospectus it says that the 2018 revenue guidance as provided under Deutsche Boerse is no longer valid under the HoldCo agreement. I'll just make a quick intro comment regarding the clearing thing around Deutsche Boerse. On the LSE side I was just wondering if you have any plans to do the same at LCH either prior to the deal closing or perhaps immediately afterwards. So I'm wondering if that's something technical. So it's still in the range of EUR2.8b to EUR3.2b and this does not change with regard to that. So we still confirm our 2018 revenue guidance what we gave to you at Deutsche Boerse. The first is I understand Deutsche Boerse is proactively taking action to increase the level of capital it has in the Eurex clearing default waterfall.

Any change in your view on the size of that within that range? Any changes in the timing of it particular, I'm guessing things like the sort of the OTC clearing proportion has been a bit delayed, whether there are any other moving parts that you'd highlight. Can you elaborate a bit on the reasons for that. Given where we sit now, I wonder if you could provide an update on that. I had a question on the part of the Accelerate program targeted EUR300 million to EUR500 million of incremental revenue opportunities out to 2018. Obviously, it was quite a wide range that EUR300 million to EUR500 million. So due to the uncertainty in the market, the market volume really dropped and you see the development in all our competitors too. So far we are fully on track to deliver our 5% to 10% revenue growth every year, so we have delivered that in 2016, you have read our guidance for 2017 and for 2018, it's basically the same. So we expect double-digit growth rates on our commodity business, European Energy Exchange where we increased our revenues up to [EUR216 million] now though we continued trend from off exchange to on exchange, our market share on exchange is now above 30% and we expect that this increase of on exchange will continue to increase over the next years. So we expect growth in the OTC clearing space and changed our view that we want to achieve some EUR50 million in 2018, [during] 2017 it will be a double-digit million euro number but clearly below that level in the transformational phase. So we see that the structural elements where we can grow will increase over time compared to the cyclical elements. So we see the general trend from OTC to on exchange, our concrete offer is to implement a central limit order book facility mid of 2017. So we want to achieve a 5% to 10% net revenue growth rate and a 10% to 15% earnings growth. So we were able to even increase our trading volume despite the other decrease. So, our view looking forward is unchanged. The good thing is that 360T gained some market share. The reason for that was we were faced with headwind from market volume overall. We will link that as a clearing solution, so we will make attractive offers to our customers and we expect that we will double-digit growth rates on 360T. Where does it come from? With regard to 360T, yes, the revenue were flattish and are behind plan. Yes, thanks for the question Daniel.",Transcript

DB1GnEUR.xbo,2017-10-27T13:00:00Z,Revenue,,,"And I refer to in my -- speaking at the beginning, just to remind us again, so OTC interest rate swap clearing is a good opportunity where we expect nice growth. And in this difficult environment, it's even good to show them 4% to 5% increase. And secondly, you flagged in your short -- very short Q3 report that you are giving -- generating and expecting a USD 50 million gain from a transaction portfolio optimization. And so overall, that's not a bad development, what we see here at 360T. And that's also our expectation that even on a stand-alone basis, so we should see better growth rate in 2018 compared to 2017. And that's the reason why, even if you did some nice price increases on a net basis, you don't see it in our RPC numbers. And therefore, we are able to show that increase, so that means we are able to further gain additional market shares, as our main competitors on a year-to-date basis are basically flattish. And we also expect for the next year that -- some cyclical -- from a cyclical perspective, we see tailwind instead of headwind. At Clearstream, 2018 will be the first full year where clients have the opportunity to benefit from TARGET2-Securities by pooling their custody business in one CSD. At Eurex, secular areas where we expect growth for next year include OTC clearing, continued product innovation, commodities trading at the European Energy Exchange, and the trading and clearing of FX product at 360T. But as also now, we have a lower starting point in 2017. But in general, we say, look, we want to grow net revenue by 5% to 10%. FX business, we expect double-digit growth; Investment Funds Services, index business, so new products at Eurex, TARGET2-Securities, so there are many initiatives around that. First of all, could you just give us an indication what triggers your confidence for the strong growth of 360T? Firstly, on your secular growth. For 2018, we expect further growth through a growing number of funds on our platform and a larger market share. For FX product at 360T, we expect a bright future because we will increasingly realize revenue synergies generated from fully electronic trading and clearing of currency terms. For commodity trading at EEX, we expect the temporary causes for depressed volumes to fade until the end of the year and the catch-up of volumes next year. Given that the historic low equity market volatility persisted in the third quarter, we are very likely not going to achieve the lower end of our net revenue and earnings guidance for the full year. If we are in all of these areas successful, then it could be more than 5% structural growth rate in 2018. In our Investment Funds Service business, we deliver state-of-the-art solutions to standardize fund processing and to increase efficiency and safety in the investment fund sector. Is there anything behind that or what's going on there? Last but not least, we expect continued growth in our index business at MD+S as we see an ongoing trend towards process investment strategies. Nevertheless, we continue to be very well-positioned to benefit from secular and cyclical growth in the midterm and are confident that we can achieve our earnings growth target of 10% to 15% in 2018 and 2019. Obviously, it's below our expectation, and our expectation is that this is an asset that should grow double-digits on a net revenue basis. Or is this restricted in some kind? Right now, you have an underlying secular growth of around 5%. So for the first question, 360T development, so currently, on a global basis, FX market is under pressure. So it's cyclically downwards on a global basis. Structural opportunities, we see at least in the range of 5%. This expectation is based on a number of secular opportunities, which will help us achieving double-digit net revenue growth in 2018.

And then secondly, just on the balance sheet, you've highlighted you expect to achieve 1 times gross leverage in the medium term. Does the Deutsche Boerse and LSE previous revenue targets still stand independent of the merger? I guess it's too early to say, but I was wondering if there's anything you can share on longer-term target pro-forma gross leverage. I understand that your revenue targets are completely incremental, but in the prospectus it says that the 2018 revenue guidance as provided under Deutsche Boerse is no longer valid under the HoldCo agreement. I'll just make a quick intro comment regarding the clearing thing around Deutsche Boerse. On the LSE side I was just wondering if you have any plans to do the same at LCH either prior to the deal closing or perhaps immediately afterwards. So I'm wondering if that's something technical. So it's still in the range of EUR2.8b to EUR3.2b and this does not change with regard to that. So we still confirm our 2018 revenue guidance what we gave to you at Deutsche Boerse. The first is I understand Deutsche Boerse is proactively taking action to increase the level of capital it has in the Eurex clearing default waterfall. We are planning to move from EUR315m to EUR365m over the coming year and that's the change that Martin is referring to. Yes.",Transcript
DB1GnEUR.xbo,2017-02-16T13:00:00Z,Revenue,,,"And secondly, if you could give us an update on the OTC clearing revenue outlook for 2017 and 2018 please? Any change in your view on the size of that within that range? Any changes in the timing of it particular, I'm guessing things like the sort of the OTC clearing proportion has been a bit delayed, whether there are any other moving parts that you'd highlight. Can you elaborate a bit on the reasons for that. Given where we sit now, I wonder if you could provide an update on that. I had a question on the part of the Accelerate program targeted EUR300 million to EUR500 million of incremental revenue opportunities out to 2018. Obviously, it was quite a wide range that EUR300 million to EUR500 million. So due to the uncertainty in the market, the market volume really dropped and you see the development in all our competitors too. So far we are fully on track to deliver our 5% to 10% revenue growth every year, so we have delivered that in 2016, you have read our guidance for 2017 and for 2018, it's basically the same. So we expect double-digit growth rates on our commodity business, European Energy Exchange where we increased our revenues up to [EUR216 million] now though we continued trend from off exchange to on exchange, our market share on exchange is now above 30% and we expect that this increase of on exchange will continue to increase over the next years. So we expect growth in the OTC clearing space and changed our view that we want to achieve some EUR50 million in 2018, [during] 2017 it will be a double-digit million euro number but clearly below that level in the transformational phase. So we see that the structural elements where we can grow will increase over time compared to the cyclical elements. So we see the general trend from OTC to on exchange, our concrete offer is to implement a central limit order book facility mid of 2017. So we want to achieve a 5% to 10% net revenue growth rate and a 10% to 15% earnings growth. So we were able to even increase our trading volume despite the other decrease. So, our view looking forward is unchanged. The good thing is that 360T gained some market share. The reason for that was we were faced with headwind from market volume overall. We will link that as a clearing solution, so we will make attractive offers to our customers and we expect that we will double-digit growth rates on 360T. Where does it come from? With regard to 360T, yes, the revenue were flattish and are behind plan. Yes, thanks for the question Daniel.",Transcript

DB1GnEUR.xbo,2017-10-27T13:00:00Z,Revenue,,,"And I refer to in my -- speaking at the beginning, just to remind us again, so OTC interest rate swap clearing is a good opportunity where we expect nice growth. And in this difficult environment, it's even good to show them 4% to 5% increase. And secondly, you flagged in your short -- very short Q3 report that you are giving -- generating and expecting a USD 50 million gain from a transaction portfolio optimization. And so overall, that's not a bad development, what we see here at 360T. And that's also our expectation that even on a stand-alone basis, so we should see better growth rate in 2018 compared to 2017. And that's the reason why, even if you did some nice price increases on a net basis, you don't see it in our RPC numbers. And therefore, we are able to show that increase, so that means we are able to further gain additional market shares, as our main competitors on a year-to-date basis are basically flattish. And we also expect for the next year that -- some cyclical -- from a cyclical perspective, we see tailwind instead of headwind. At Clearstream, 2018 will be the first full year where clients have the opportunity to benefit from TARGET2-Securities by pooling their custody business in one CSD. At Eurex, secular areas where we expect growth for next year include OTC clearing, continued product innovation, commodities trading at the European Energy Exchange, and the trading and clearing of FX product at 360T. But as also now, we have a lower starting point in 2017. But in general, we say, look, we want to grow net revenue by 5% to 10%. FX business, we expect double-digit growth; Investment Funds Services, index business, so new products at Eurex, TARGET2-Securities, so there are many initiatives around that. First of all, could you just give us an indication what triggers your confidence for the strong growth of 360T? Firstly, on your secular growth. For 2018, we expect further growth through a growing number of funds on our platform and a larger market share. For FX product at 360T, we expect a bright future because we will increasingly realize revenue synergies generated from fully electronic trading and clearing of currency terms. For commodity trading at EEX, we expect the temporary causes for depressed volumes to fade until the end of the year and the catch-up of volumes next year. Given that the historic low equity market volatility persisted in the third quarter, we are very likely not going to achieve the lower end of our net revenue and earnings guidance for the full year. If we are in all of these areas successful, then it could be more than 5% structural growth rate in 2018. In our Investment Funds Service business, we deliver state-of-the-art solutions to standardize fund processing and to increase efficiency and safety in the investment fund sector. Is there anything behind that or what's going on there? Last but not least, we expect continued growth in our index business at MD+S as we see an ongoing trend towards process investment strategies. Nevertheless, we continue to be very well-positioned to benefit from secular and cyclical growth in the midterm and are confident that we can achieve our earnings growth target of 10% to 15% in 2018 and 2019. Obviously, it's below our expectation, and our expectation is that this is an asset that should grow double-digits on a net revenue basis. Or is this restricted in some kind? Right now, you have an underlying secular growth of around 5%. So for the first question, 360T development, so currently, on a global basis, FX market is under pressure. So it's cyclically downwards on a global basis. Structural opportunities, we see at least in the range of 5%. This expectation is based on a number of secular opportunities, which will help us achieving double-digit net revenue growth in 2018. Turning back to Eurex, if we look at the index revenue of 84 -- profits of EUR 84 million, given the volumes, that lo",Transcript

So this year, the run rate for Open Trading revenue, take the first 6 months, I'm not saying that's what it will be for the full year. We take the first 6 months, it's something like $175 million in revenue.",Transcript

Can you talk about how that plays into electronic trading volume? I think that has been the main accelerant of forcing automation in the underlying. In an ETF universe, the -- an electronic market maker needs to source the bonds. It is driving the market maker that sits in the market to trade the ETF into trying to automate what has been a non-automated market. It's either substitutes for fixed income securities or how the ETFs themselves could be traded? Open Trading is certainly a reflection of the pricing advantage that an ETF market maker can offer to the overall corporate bond market because they are trading and are between the ETF and the market -- the underlying market. So in a traditional fund complex, you put your money in, and the fund manager goes and trades the bonds the old-fashioned way. So they're a much more aggressive market maker in that market and that's been critical to the growth, things like Open Trading. So they've been a huge part of the MarketAxess growth. The growth in fixed income ETFs has been pretty outstanding from the industry and BlackRock especially. They have to go into the market and buy and collect all those bonds. They're not trading on spread in the corporate bond market. Well, the ET -- I think the growth of fixed income ETFs have been instrumental to the change that we're seeing in automation around the underlying corporate market. Well, the best way they source anything is electronically. You've seen pretty good growth there.",Transcript

MKTX.O,2019-08-13T16:30:00Z,Revenue,,,"And the beauty with this model, you saw on one of the slides where volume growth is up 60%, for example, second quarter this year versus second quarter last year. And then also, the RPM looks like something in the mid-3s. And then if -- and then maybe it looks like July backing into that on market share that's provided by Greenwich might be $18 billion or $19 billion on a daily basis, if I'm right on that. Good afternoon, and welcome to the MarketAxess conference call to discuss our acquisition of LiquidityEdge. I think the $25 billion you're referencing those days in August where we've seen big news in the tenure. Is that about right? LiquidityEdge has seen significant revenue growth in the last year with revenue of $9.2 million in 2018, up from $2.3 million in 2017. Maybe just to talk about the -- it looks like volume has spiked up quite a bit since 2Q '19. So Brian, I'll take the -- I think you're right on all those accounts. So if you're seeing 60% up year-over-year, revenue will be up in a similar territory. There were some recent days in that $25 billion a day range. There's no fixed monthly fees or distribution fees, both as Chris has just mentioned, there's a -- the model is both liquidity provider and liquidity taker do pay a fee, our assessment fee. We expect this new business to add to our overall revenue diversification. When you see volume increases like that, that's going to translate to revenue increases.",Transcript

Autoresponder allows them to actually respond to other RFQs that are in the market, using Open Trading the anonymous feature. So Chris, what we're going to do, and again keeping with that theme of being fully transparent and timely with delivering information, we're going to stick with the monthly volume reporting. So we expect to see higher growth rates of transaction volume as well as volume feeding through our entire auto functionality. We do have some agency and government bond reporting in there, but you'll see that 99% of it is going to be U.S. treasury reporting. We estimate 2% to 4% of TRACE volume but growing rapidly, and we want to be sure to have the solution in place for our clients, which we will roll out this quarter. We're going to report volume in 3 buckets, which will be U.S. high-grade other credits, those are the existing categories that we have today, and the third category will be rates.",Transcript
