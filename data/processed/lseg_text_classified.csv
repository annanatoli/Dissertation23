And that's really being supported primarily by pricing initiatives, in addition to some monitored credit growth with, I'd say, minimal impact from foreign currency translation. But just the recurring line item that you guys report on the ratings side, there's obviously the constant rating of all outstanding bonds in there. But we don't necessarily think there will be a material impact to that recurring revenue line. But what else is in that line item? But where was that incremental pressure that caused that slight reduction? For example, increasing virtual sales meetings and adapting to customer purchasing behavior by launching new product features and otherwise addressing what I think of as pertinent customer needs. However, the delays of CECL, Basel III, IFRS 17 has put a little bit of additional pressure on the underlying ERS growth rate. I'd say that we expect lower growth in both the RD&A and the ERS lines of business. In terms of the 2020 outlook, Rob also mentioned on the April earnings call that if we see a meaningful increase in defaults, we could have some attrition from rated issuers. In your updated guidance, I think it was low double digits before, now it's high single digits, which is still an impressive number, especially in this environment. Maybe just shifting to the analytics business real quick. So organic growth is a good place for me to start. The increase also includes revenue contribution from the Vigeo Eiris and Four Twenty Seven acquisitions. We are actively mitigating factors impacting our sales activities. We expect revenue growth to be impacted by COVID-19 with regard to our ability to close on sales from the existing pipeline as well as the ability to generate new sales opportunities in the upcoming quarters. With approximately 6-ish weeks of experience under these conditions, we've updated our sales outlook to incorporate the impacts of COVID-19 on our sales generation for the remainder of 2020. You can see that recurring revenue was 35% of total revenue in the first quarter 2020, which is down 39% in the prior year, given the strength of supply that we saw in the first quarter in 2020.

And that's really being supported primarily by pricing initiatives, in addition to some monitored credit growth with, I'd say, minimal impact from foreign currency translation. But just the recurring line item that you guys report on the ratings side, there's obviously the constant rating of all outstanding bonds in there. But we don't necessarily think there will be a material impact to that recurring revenue line. But what else is in that line item? But where was that incremental pressure that caused that slight reduction? For example, increasing virtual sales meetings and adapting to customer purchasing behavior by launching new product features and otherwise addressing what I think of as pertinent customer needs. However, the delays of CECL, Basel III, IFRS 17 has put a little bit of additional pressure on the underlying ERS growth rate. I'd say that we expect lower growth in both the RD&A and the ERS lines of business. In terms of the 2020 outlook, Rob also mentioned on the April earnings call that if we see a meaningful increase in defaults, we could have some attrition from rated issuers. In your updated guidance, I think it was low double digits before, now it's high single digits, which is still an impressive number, especially in this environment. Maybe just shifting to the analytics business real quick. So organic growth is a good place for me to start. The increase also includes revenue contribution from the Vigeo Eiris and Four Twenty Seven acquisitions. We are actively mitigating factors impacting our sales activities. We expect revenue growth to be impacted by COVID-19 with regard to our ability to close on sales from the existing pipeline as well as the ability to generate new sales opportunities in the upcoming quarters. With approximately 6-ish weeks of experience under these conditions, we've updated our sales outlook to incorporate the impacts of COVID-19 on our sales generation for the remainder of 2020. You can see that recurring revenue was 35% of total revenue in the first quarter 2020, which is down 39% in the prior year, given the strength of supply that we saw in the first quarter in 2020.

And then there is also continued work around making the Ratings organization more effective, taking complexity out, taking layers of the organization out and making it more an effective organization. And we have in fact seen that in periods where the debt issuance market was a bit weaker at the end of last year, the beginning of this year, our margins were still developing in a favorable way, and now we can continue on that also when the issuance markets look more favorable. But you should expect basically the same trends, the same activities, the same management actions to continue in the future. Continued revenue growth, which is a combination of new issuance, refinancings, of course commercial contract changes, new initiatives that we put in place in Ratings, think about the ESG Evaluations, think about our launch of Ratings activities in other countries around the world.

And just I guess just some additional color on what drove the margins down in the quarter would be helpful. And the reason is that we are also seeing, at the same time, the benefits of our productivity plans. Do you need sort of like a mid-single-digit growth to get that leverage there? If you look at the margin development in the first quarter of Ratings, we are overall satisfied with the results we are seeing. My first question is on Ratings' margins.

Therefore, we are providing guidance on corporate unallocated expense excluding any revenue of $155 million to $165 million; deal-related amortization of $120 million to $125 million; Kensho retention plans of $20 million to $25 million; operating profit margin in the range of 48.8% to 49.8%; interest expense of $145 million to $150 million; a tax rate of 22.5% to 23.5%, this is an increase over 2018 because we expect to have a lower benefit from employee stock-based compensation as well as less discrete benefits from prior year tax adjustments; and diluted EPS, which excludes deal-related amortization, of $8.95 to $9.15. This slide depicts our GAAP guidance. This slide shows our adjusted guidance, an increase in revenue of mid-single-digits with contributions by every business segment. Unfortunately, Ratings fell short due to market factors. We are pleased to use this morning's investor call to reiterate these targets and to share the great progress we have made in just the first year. We have decided to record Kensho revenue in Market Intelligence going forward. We target low double-digit adjusted EPS growth.

And then just overall on pricing, I remember 5 to 7 years ago, when we first started covering the rating agencies, we were talking about the average price of an issuance at 5 basis points. But otherwise, corporate and financial institutions revenue was up each and every year over the last 16 years. But what we could say is historically every year, a normal price increase would be a couple of percent points. It's growing year-by-year over the last 16 years with the exception of 2008, when the drop of corporate and financial institutions revenue was 7%. So I think if you look at what do we expect for Ratings revenues -- and by the way, this is pretty stable over a longer period of time. So how we look at it is future growth will be GDP growth plus a few percent price increase plus then all of the initiatives that we're taking. So in a stressed scenario of 2008, it was only 7% down.

But in addition to that, I think what you see reflected is the operating leverage of the business in the context of an industry segment where [occludedly] the revenue impact of the decline in the energy sector, which impacted overall revenues, with that operating leverage, is going to have a bigger impact on the margin. Can you just help understand why it's so different? I know that was pound and, I guess, IFRS number, but in the low-30s. I mean, I think when Verisk acquired Wood Mackenzie, they had disclosed the 2014 margin at 47%. No, I think in the quarterly reviews that -- our expectation is that we will be talking about the underwriting and rating segment in terms of the growth dynamics and the claims segment. Or is that done with for now? So I think when you look at it historically, certainly, there is a -- at a reported level, a currency impact that influences that.

And that is based not only on top line but also on margins. But what I wanted to give was, what is that impact for the entire year? First of all, Helen, can you just -- you made the comment at the end there about the fourth quarter, I think, 60 to 75 basis points. Given its timing and nature, an increase in ASV in the fourth quarter will not materially change revenue in fiscal year '21, but would result in a higher bonus accrual. I wanted to follow-up on the margin question earlier and the impact of higher bonus accruals. I would also add what we're seeing come through that likely on the tax rate side, we'll be on the lower end as well. Or how would you characterize that 60 to 75? Right. So I think that, that is a fair way of thinking about it. So in this particular quarter, because once we had greater visibility, Alex, into where we would see -- we anticipate for the year, then we had to both true-up for the first half as well as increase for Q3. So the 60 to 75 would have been beyond what we would have provided in terms of our original plan. So the way I think about it is really 60 to 75 for the year. So we should take both of those into a bit of consideration. So yes, the impact for the year is higher. The 60 to 75 bps of margin impact full year, can you clarify if that's relative to your original margin expectations for fiscal 2021 which would imply you would land in the bottom half of your guidance range? The related expense would impact our margins by an incremental 60 to 75 basis points. Was that relative to what we just saw in the third quarter? We believe that we will remain within our stated annual guidance ranges. We do think from a margin perspective, though, overall, we'll be on the lower end of our range.

And again, 8% to 10% next year assumes refi has come down 20%. And by the way, we assume it'd come down another over 30% in year 2, and we still think that we're going to be able to grow the business.

And then for the next decade plus. And what other kind of key factors here are going to get to that 8% to 10% upside over the near term? But what are you guys doing on that? I think, in my opinion, I think that originations on the mortgage side with 90% plus borrowers, still with a 50 basis point incentive to refi, would be a #1 contributor with a pretty large tail here. So in the near term, the first thing, not to pick on the question, but the growth of 8% to 10% assumes that the refis are down significantly, more than 20% actually.

In terms of the steady state or normalized MSCI EBITDA margin, it's probably going to be lower than our existing product suite, which has an 80% margin. No reason why they would be lower or higher.

Good afternoon, and welcome to the MarketAxess conference call to discuss our acquisition of LiquidityEdge. I think the $25 billion you're referencing those days in August where we've seen big news in the tenure. Is that about right?

So if you're seeing 60% up year-over-year, revenue will be up in a similar territory. There were some recent days in that $25 billion a day range.

In an ETF universe, the -- an electronic market maker needs to source the bonds. It is driving the market maker that sits in the market to trade the ETF into trying to automate what has been a non-automated market. It's either substitutes for fixed income securities or how the ETFs themselves could be traded? Open Trading is certainly a reflection of the pricing advantage that an ETF market maker can offer to the overall corporate bond market because they are trading and are between the ETF and the market -- the underlying market. So in a traditional fund complex, you put your money in, and the fund manager goes and trades the bonds the old-fashioned way. So they're a much more aggressive market maker in that market and that's been critical to the growth, things like Open Trading. So they've been a huge part of the MarketAxess growth.
